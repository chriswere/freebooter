<description><![CDATA[<p>A long-running planning saga at Llancayo, near Usk, has ended with
approval for a Travellers’ site — almost a decade after the family first
moved onto the land without consent.</p>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council’s planning committee confirmed its
decision this summer to allow <strong>four family-related
pitches</strong> on land opposite Llancayo House, despite strong
opposition from the local community council and some neighbours.</p>
<p>The development will provide each pitch with a static caravan, a
touring caravan, and a day/utility room, together with ecological
enhancements, new landscaping, and an emergency flood access. A new
<strong>biological treatment plant</strong> and drainage system have
been designed to address earlier concerns about pollution in the nearby
<strong>River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-disputes">A History of Disputes</h2>
<p>The Jones and Purcell family, who are from the Gypsy and Traveller
community, have lived at the site since 2016. Their first planning
application for six pitches was refused later that year, citing its
location in open countryside, poor drainage, and highway safety
issues.</p>
<p>An enforcement notice was served requiring the family to leave, but
appeals to the Planning Inspectorate, the High Court, and the Court of
Appeal followed. The family remained on the site throughout.</p>
<p>The latest application scaled back the scheme from six to
<strong>four pitches</strong> and dropped earlier proposals for stables
and kennels. Officers said this reduction allowed more space for
drainage infrastructure and improved the site’s layout.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-scrutiny">Environmental Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Because the site drains towards the River Usk, the proposal triggered
a full <strong>Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA)</strong>. Natural
Resources Wales (NRW) warned that untreated effluent could damage
protected fish species, including twaite and allis shad.</p>
<p>To meet strict rules on phosphates, the family’s agents submitted a
detailed <strong>Nutrient Neutrality Assessment and Mitigation
Strategy</strong>. This proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>GRAF One2Clean biological treatment plant</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>limestone filter bed</strong> to further strip out
phosphorus</li>
<li>A <strong>drainage field</strong> of at least 250m², tested to show
the ground can absorb wastewater</li>
</ul>
<p>The system was designed for up to 16–18 people — more than the likely
occupancy of 12 across the four pitches — giving what officers called
<em>“a comfortable margin of safety.”</em></p>
<p>NRW eventually accepted the calculations, concluding that, with
conditions in place, the project would <strong>not harm the River Usk
SAC</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="objections-and-concerns">Objections and Concerns</h2>
<p>Despite the technical approvals, <strong>Llanarth Fawr Community
Council</strong> lodged strong objections. It argued that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drainage field is too small and sits on heavy mudstone that
could lead to effluent runoff</li>
<li>The site is close to flood zones, with the emergency escape route
itself predicted to flood in a 1-in-100 year event</li>
<li>The layout does not meet all safety standards in Welsh Government
guidance for Traveller sites</li>
</ul>
<p>The council warned the scheme could worsen local flooding and said
unmet need for Traveller sites should not override environmental
risks.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-need-and-impact">Balancing Need and Impact</h2>
<p>Planning officers acknowledged the objections but stressed
Monmouthshire has a legal duty to provide Traveller accommodation. Its
most recent <strong>Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation
Assessment</strong>, approved by Welsh Government in 2024, identified a
need for 13 additional pitches in the county.</p>
<p>They concluded the Llancayo site would help meet this need, and that
revised drainage, flood access, and ecological measures meant the scheme
now complied with planning policy.</p>
<h2 id="the-decision">The Decision</h2>
<p>The planning committee first voted in July 2024 to approve the
application, subject to confirmation from Natural Resources Wales that
the site would not harm the River Usk SAC. That confirmation arrived in
summer 2025, allowing the council to formally grant permission.</p>
<p>The approval comes with conditions requiring the drainage system to
be installed and maintained as designed, ecological features (such as
bird and bat boxes) to be provided, and an emergency flood access to be
constructed.</p>
<p>While campaigners against the scheme remain disappointed, the family
now has security of tenure on the land they have occupied for nine
years.</p>]]></description>

<title>Bungalow approved for rear of Park Close property after controversial debate</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A controversial plan to build a bungalow in the back garden of a Park
Close home has been given the green light by Monmouthshire County
Council, following months of debate and several amendments to the
scheme.</p>
<p>The application sought permission to construct a single-storey
property with its own parking and turning space behind 11 Park Close in
Abergavenny.</p>
<p>The scheme was first brought before councillors in January, when it
faced strong opposition over the narrow three-metre access lane, which
fell short of Welsh planning standards. A tied vote in February left the
decision hanging, but the applicant later submitted revised plans with
improved parking and manoeuvring space, as well as details on drainage
and biodiversity measures.</p>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council maintained its objection, raising issues
around drainage, biodiversity, and potential access disputes between
neighbours. Several local residents also criticised the plan, warning of
loss of green space, privacy concerns, and overdevelopment of the
area.</p>
<p>Despite these objections, county highways officers withdrew their
earlier concerns, concluding that the updated design provided safe
access and sufficient parking. Biodiversity officers accepted new
measures, including bird boxes, hedgehog-friendly fencing, and
landscaping, while flood and drainage specialists confirmed that surface
water could be managed through a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS).
Archaeologists also noted that the site sits in a sensitive area,
requiring mitigation work during construction.</p>
<p>Planning officers recommended approval, highlighting that the
bungalow’s design was modest, single-storey, and in keeping with the
area, with minimal impact on neighbouring homes. Councillors agreed,
granting permission subject to strict conditions — including removal of
permitted development rights, landscaping requirements, and a financial
contribution towards affordable housing.</p>]]></description>
