<description><![CDATA[<p>Welsh Water (also known as Dŵr Cymru) is once again facing sharp criticism over its performance, staffing plans, and executive pay, raising questions about whether the utility is meeting its responsibilities to the people of Wales.</p>
<p>At a recent Senedd session (17th September 2025), Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders highlighted that over the next 18 to 24 months, Welsh Water plans to cut up to 500 jobs, representing a 12% reduction in staff. She raised concerns that these cuts are being proposed even as the company transitions to a new chief executive, Roch Cheroux, and noted that water bills have increased by around 27%.</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change, Huw Irranca-Davies, responded that the Welsh Government is focused on performance and engages regularly with Dŵr Cymru. He noted that investment will be made to improve water quality and flood prevention, and that voluntary redundancies and staff reallocation will be prioritized to minimize job losses. Mr Irranca-Davies added that the Welsh Government continues to assess the company’s performance and push for improvements.</p>
<p>Concerns over environmental impacts remain pressing. Reports indicate that raw sewage has been discharged into Welsh waterways over 100,000 times in the past year, with rivers such as the Wye, Usk, and Teifi identified as being in very poor health. Previous scrutiny from Liberal Democrat MS Jane Dodds highlighted that executives received significant bonuses during periods of poor performance and pollution incidents, raising questions about accountability.</p>
<p>Dŵr Cymru confirmed that its Chief Executive and Chief Finance Officer would forgo bonuses for the 2022-23 financial year. The company stated that executive remuneration is decided by an independent Remuneration Committee and is subject to oversight by its Members.</p>
<p>Despite these assurances, politicians continue to press for fundamental reforms, including a new independent economic regulator for Wales and a potential Welsh Water Bill, to address ongoing governance and environmental challenges.</p>]]></description>

<title>Labour just gets more pathetic on Gaza</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Labour’s foreign policy weakness was exposed, yet again, in Parliament when Green Party MP Ellie Chowns asked some pretty strightforward questions on Gaza. Had ministers secured any timeframe for Israel to ease the blockade and allow aid through? Would Israel be held accountable for the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding daily? And when would the UK publish its long-promised review of the 2030 UK–Israel Roadmap?</p>
<p>The answers she received from Hamish Falconer, the new Labour minister at the Foreign Office, were evasive at best. Rather than engage with her concerns, he referred back to a months-old statement by David Lammy, the former Foreign Secretary. The government had nothing new to say, despite the situation in Gaza worsening with every passing week.</p>
<p>This revealed the hollow centre of Labour’s approach to foreign affairs. While Ellie Chowns urges the Government to hold Israel to account for starving civilians and blocking aid, Mr Falconer chose to hand-wave the concerns away. This is not a government acting with conviction, but of a party afraid to take any kind of stand against an unfolding genocide.</p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is accelerating. Children are starving, hospitals are shutting down, and families are being driven from their homes. Yet the Labour government, faced with clear and direct questions, are paralysed. Their vague condemnations of Israeli actions have become a tired ritual: mealy-mouthed words in Parliament and no tangible steps to stop the suffering.</p>
<p>By ignoring Ms Chowns’s well-founded concerns, Labour is saying that it prefers to avoid questions rather than confront them. It is a dangerous form of cowardice, and it leaves Britain silent at a time when clarity and moral courage are needed.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Welsh Government has been accused of avoiding clear answers on how it plans to respond to a key <strong>Supreme Court ruling</strong> on the legal definition of sex, after questions were raised again in the Senedd this week.</p>
<p>On <strong>16 September 2025</strong>, <a href="https://senedd.wales/people/4562">Ms Laura Anne Jones MS</a> (Reform UK, South Wales East) pressed the Government for an update, noting that <strong>five months</strong> had passed since the court decision.</p>
<p>She told the Senedd: “Surely enough time has now passed for you to adapt to the law and even, perhaps, establish what a woman actually is. But given the significance, I would like to once again ask for an oral statement on the floor of the Senedd on what actions the Welsh Government has taken to rectify its policies so that they now fall in line with the Supreme Court ruling.”</p>
<p>The ruling confirmed that, under the Equality Act, the term <strong>“woman” must mean a biological woman</strong>, which has implications for single-sex spaces such as refuges, hospital wards and toilets.</p>
<p>Responding, <strong>Ms Jane Hutt MS</strong> (Welsh Labour, Vale of Glamorgan), Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, did not commit to immediate changes. Instead, she pointed to ongoing work at Westminster, saying the <strong>Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</strong> had recently reported on its consultation and that the matter was now with the UK Government’s <strong>Minister for Women and Equalities, Ms Bridget Phillipson MP</strong>.</p>
<p>Ms Hutt told Members: “That now of course rests with Westminster… in due course we will hear the outcome of their consideration.”</p>
<p>The exchange highlighted growing frustration from opposition Members who say the Welsh Government is <strong>“kicking the can down the road”</strong> instead of setting out how policies in Wales will be updated.</p>
<p>Campaigners argue that with so many services affected - from women’s refuges to hospital wards - staff and service users need clarity now. Others say the issue is complex and requires careful handling.</p>
<p>For now, however, the Government has given no timeline for when a statement will be made in the Senedd or when Welsh policies will be reviewed.</p>]]></description>

</li>
<li>Clauses in contracts that try to stop workers speaking out about harassment or discrimination will be banned.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unfair Dismissal</strong>

<title>Ellie Chowns challenges government on social housing targets</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:24:11 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Green MP Ellie Chowns has pressed the Labour government to set clear targets for the delivery of new social housing. Speaking during a debate in the House of Commons on 15 September 2025, Ms Chowns asked Housing Minister Mr Matthew Pennycook why the government has refused to commit to specific numbers. (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-09-15/debates/78F1791B-B4A1-4F7A-B676-6B07A9F4D56E/SocialHousing">Hansard, HC Deb, 15 September 2025, c1314</a>)</p>
<h2 id="ms-chowns-asks-why-no-targets-are-being-set">Ms Chowns asks why no targets are being set</h2>
<p>Ms Chowns asked:<br />
&gt; “Given that the Minister feels that social housing is so important, can he explain why he will not set a target for it?”</p>
<p>When Mr Pennycook avoided the direct “why,” Ms Chowns followed up simply with:<br />
&gt; “The question was why.”</p>
<h2 id="government-says-targets-are-under-review">Government says targets are under review</h2>
<p>Mr Pennycook responded that the government had discussed the issue “many, many occasions” but was still not setting a target. He argued that long-term forecasting was “inherently challenging” but insisted that social housing remained central to the government’s housing strategy.</p>
<p>The Minister highlighted the government’s £39 billion Affordable Homes Programme, running from 2026 to 2036. He said around 300,000 social and affordable homes could be delivered during that time, with at least 180,000 for social rent.</p>
<p>He confirmed that 60% of the homes funded through the programme would be for social rent.</p>
<h2 id="funding-and-reforms">Funding and reforms</h2>
<p>Mr Pennycook said the government was taking steps to make it easier for councils to build. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>allowing councils to keep all receipts from right-to-buy sales for reinvestment<br />
</li>
<li>offering a preferential borrowing rate through the Public Works Loan Board, which has already enabled £6 billion of council borrowing<br />
</li>
<li>launching a £12 million skills and capacity programme with Homes England and the Local Government Association</li>
</ul>
<p>The Minister also pointed to planned reforms of the right-to-buy scheme, including exemptions for newly built homes and giving councils first option to repurchase properties sold on the open market.</p>
<h2 id="a-debate-still-unresolved">A debate still unresolved</h2>
<p>Despite these commitments, Ms Chowns’s question about why the government will not set a clear target for social housing went unanswered. The exchange highlights a continuing debate between those calling for binding goals and a government that prefers flexibility, even while promising the “biggest increase in social and affordable house building in a generation.”</p>]]></description>

<title>Ed Miliband sidelined as Prime Minister backs AI over hydrogen</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:22:29 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has been sidelined in a high-profile Cabinet row after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer chose to back plans for a massive data centre on Teesside instead of a major hydrogen energy project.</p>
<p>The move has been seen as a blow to Mr Miliband’s net zero agenda, raising questions about how much influence he holds in government decision-making.<br />
(<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/12/starmer-snubs-miliband-hydrogen-teesside-ai-growth-zone/">The Telegraph, 12 September 2025</a>)</p>
<h2 id="prime-minister-overrules-energy-secretary">Prime Minister overrules Energy Secretary</h2>
<p>The hydrogen scheme, known as H2Teesside, was proposed by BP and supported by Mr Miliband. It would have produced “blue” hydrogen, supplying up to 10% of the hydrogen Britain is expected to need by 2030.</p>
<p>But the Prime Minister has backed a rival plan for Europe’s largest data centre on nearby land, declaring the Teesworks site an “AI growth zone.” The two projects were judged to be incompatible, effectively ending hopes for the hydrogen plant.</p>
<p>The decision was confirmed in a letter from Business Secretary Mr Peter Kyle to Tees Valley Mayor Lord Houchen, which described the data centre as “the cornerstone of the UK’s AI strategy.”</p>
<h2 id="a-cabinet-clash-over-priorities">A Cabinet clash over priorities</h2>
<p>Mr Miliband had delayed a ruling on the hydrogen project until the end of October, seeking more information and keeping the option alive. He also held the power to grant a development consent order, which could have forced the project through.</p>
<p>Instead, Sir Keir moved first, with the designation of the AI growth zone effectively shutting down the plan his Energy Secretary supported. Reports suggest that the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology even prepared legal advice in case Mr Miliband tried to push ahead.</p>
<p>The outcome has been interpreted as Sir Keir putting his authority above Mr Miliband’s, choosing technology investment and AI growth over a central part of the Energy Secretary’s climate policy.</p>
<h2 id="bp-left-in-limbo">BP left in limbo</h2>
<p>BP has said it remains committed to H2Teesside and continues to hold talks with the government, though it admitted the plant does not yet have a main customer. The company has argued that the project should not be blocked by “speculative development.”</p>
<p>For now, both BP and the wider energy sector are left uncertain, with Mr Miliband’s flagship plan set aside in favour of Sir Keir’s AI strategy.</p>
<h2 id="net-zero-or-ai">Net zero or AI?</h2>
<p>The decision underscores the tension inside government between meeting net zero pledges and building up Britain’s artificial intelligence sector.</p>
<p>Sir Keir is keen to demonstrate commitment to AI as he prepares to sign a “technology partnership” with US President Donald Trump next week.</p>
<p>A government spokesman defended the decision, saying: “Any infrastructure decision this Government makes will be in the national interest – helping deliver the Government’s Plan for Change.”</p>
<p>Lord Houchen has warned that Britain “cannot afford to dither and delay” in the race to attract AI investment, and argued that the hydrogen project would have had a “sterilising effect” on the Teesside data centre.</p>
<p>But the sidelining of Mr Miliband highlights a Cabinet divide – and raises doubts about how far net zero goals will be prioritised when they come into conflict with the Prime Minister’s technology ambitions.</p>]]></description>

(<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/12/starmer-snubs-miliband-hydrogen-teesside-ai-growth-zone/">The Telegraph, 12 September 2025</a>)</p>
<h2 id="prime-minister-overrules-energy-secretary">Prime Minister overrules Energy Secretary</h2>
<p>The hydrogen scheme, known as H2Teesside, was proposed by BP and supported by Mr Miliband. It would have produced “blue” hydrogen, supplying up to 10% of the hydrogen Britain is expected to need by 2030.</p>
<p>But the Prime Minister has backed a rival plan for Europe’s largest data centre on nearby land, declaring the Teesworks site an “AI growth zone.” The two projects were judged to be incompatible, effectively ending hopes for the hydrogen plant.</p>
<p>The decision was confirmed in a letter from Business Secretary Mr Peter Kyle to Tees Valley Mayor Lord Houchen, which described the data centre as “the cornerstone of the UK’s AI strategy.”</p>
<h2 id="a-cabinet-clash-over-priorities">A Cabinet clash over priorities</h2>
<p>Mr Miliband had delayed a ruling on the hydrogen project until the end of October, seeking more information and keeping the option alive. He also held the power to grant a development consent order, which could have forced the project through.</p>
<p>Instead, Sir Keir moved first, with the designation of the AI growth zone effectively shutting down the plan his Energy Secretary supported. Reports suggest that the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology even prepared legal advice in case Mr Miliband tried to push ahead.</p>
<p>The outcome has been interpreted as Sir Keir putting his authority above Mr Miliband’s, choosing technology investment and AI growth over a central part of the Energy Secretary’s climate policy.</p>
<h2 id="bp-left-in-limbo">BP left in limbo</h2>
<p>BP has said it remains committed to H2Teesside and continues to hold talks with the government, though it admitted the plant does not yet have a main customer. The company has argued that the project should not be blocked by “speculative development.”</p>
<p>For now, both BP and the wider energy sector are left uncertain, with Mr Miliband’s flagship plan set aside in favour of Sir Keir’s AI strategy.</p>
<h2 id="net-zero-or-ai">Net zero or AI?</h2>
<p>The decision underscores the tension inside government between meeting net zero pledges and building up Britain’s artificial intelligence sector.</p>
<p>Sir Keir is keen to demonstrate commitment to AI as he prepares to sign a “technology partnership” with US President Donald Trump next week.</p>
<p>A government spokesman defended the decision, saying: “Any infrastructure decision this Government makes will be in the national interest – helping deliver the Government’s Plan for Change.”</p>
<p>Lord Houchen has warned that Britain “cannot afford to dither and delay” in the race to attract AI investment, and argued that the hydrogen project would have had a “sterilising effect” on the Teesside data centre.</p>
<p>But the sidelining of Mr Miliband highlights a Cabinet divide – and raises doubts about how far net zero goals will be prioritised when they come into conflict with the Prime Minister’s technology ambitions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council’s Planning Committee has approved a major new residential development at Drewen Farm, completing the housing allocation for the strategic Wonastow Road site. The decision follows careful consideration of environmental, transport, and community impacts, and approval comes with a series of conditions and planning obligations to ensure the development meets local needs and protects the surrounding environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwcBnI-L_co">The full planning meeting where this was discussed can be found here</a></p>
<h2 id="the-proposed-development">The proposed development</h2>
<p>The Drewen Farm development will see <strong>110 new homes</strong> constructed on the final part of the strategic Wonastow Road site, as allocated in the Monmouthshire Local Development Plan (LDP). The scheme includes a mix of housing types and tenures, designed to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Affordable housing:</strong> 35% of all homes (39 units) will be affordable, primarily social rent. The mix includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-person, 1-bedroom flats: 62%</li>
<li>4-person, 2-bedroom houses: 23%</li>
<li>5-person, 3-bedroom houses: 10%</li>
<li>7-person, 4-bedroom houses: 3%</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Public open space and play areas:</strong> An off-site contribution of approximately £58,000 will fund fixed play facilities at Rockfield Park or Drybridge Park, accessible via active travel links.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biodiversity enhancements:</strong> A sum of £40,000–£45,000 will support the protection and restoration of the SINC (Site of Importance for Nature Conservation) on the site, including ongoing maintenance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustainable transport improvements:</strong> £255,000 will be invested in walking, cycling, and bus services, including new active travel routes linking the development to Monmouth town centre.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Education contribution:</strong> £439,652 to support local schools for the anticipated 23 additional pupils from the development.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The development will also include new pedestrian and cycle paths, landscaped open spaces, and sustainable drainage systems, with a focus on protecting and enhancing local trees, woodland, and hedgerows.</p>
<h2 id="addressing-community-concerns">Addressing community concerns</h2>
<p>During the planning process, residents and the Town Council raised questions about traffic, drainage, and environmental impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access:</strong> Primary access will be via the existing Kingswood Gate development. Watery Lane will be retained solely for pedestrian, cycling, and emergency vehicle access; no regular vehicle traffic will use this route.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction management:</strong> A Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) will be required before work begins to ensure construction traffic uses approved routes, with measures to control dust, noise, and other nuisances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Noise:</strong> A detailed noise assessment will be undertaken to assess the impact of nearby industrial activity, with mitigation measures implemented where needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drainage and flood risk:</strong> The site is mostly in Flood Zone 1. Low-lying areas will be managed with cut-off ditches and detention basins. The final drainage scheme will require approval under the Sustainable Drainage Approval Body (SAB) process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heritage and ecology:</strong> Archaeological mitigation measures and species protection plans, including a dormouse strategy, will be implemented. A Green Infrastructure Management Plan will ensure ongoing care for the site’s natural features.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planning-obligations-and-conditions">Planning obligations and conditions</h2>
<p>To support sustainable development, the Council has set out detailed conditions and obligations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affordable housing provision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Off-site contributions for play, biodiversity, transport, PROW, and education</strong></li>
<li><strong>S278 agreements</strong> for access and road improvements</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive landscaping and green infrastructure plans</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flood protection, drainage, and pollution prevention measures</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and maintenance of ecological and landscape features</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In total, the planning conditions cover <strong>22 areas</strong>, ensuring the development is safe, sustainable, and sensitive to local surroundings.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h2>
<p>With planning approval granted, the developer can now proceed to the <strong>reserved matters stage</strong>, where detailed designs for the layout, appearance, landscaping, and scale of the homes will be submitted for final approval. Construction will follow, guided by the approved management and environmental plans to minimize disruption and protect local amenities.</p>
<p>Residents can expect the first stages of work to focus on site preparation, sustainable drainage installation, and landscape protection, with ongoing monitoring to ensure the site is developed in line with planning conditions.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouth eyes major new festival after carnival success  </title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouth could soon be home to a brand-new music festival, following a pitch at the latest <strong>Full Council meeting</strong> on Monday 14th July 2025.</p>
<p>Ceri Jones, one of the organisers behind <strong>Monmouth Carnival</strong>, addressed councillors during the public participation session to share the exciting idea. Building on the success of the Carnival’s <strong>Battle of the Bands</strong>, Jones and fellow organisers hope to launch a <strong>three-day festival</strong> at the end of June 2026, running alongside Carnival weekend on <strong>Chippenham Mead</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-festival-vision">A new festival vision</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proposed festival would be <strong>shorter than the old Monmouth Music Festival</strong> (3 days instead of 9).<br />
</li>
<li>Rough site layouts and a <strong>mock poster</strong> were shown at the meeting.<br />
</li>
<li>Early discussions with current Monmouth Music Festival members suggest there is support for the new venture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ms Jones explained that the festival could cost around <strong>£100,000 to stage</strong>, with organisers planning to apply for <strong>grants, sponsorships, and match-funding</strong>. If ticketed, entry could cost about <strong>£25</strong>, potentially attracting <strong>10,000 people</strong> and raising enough for a profit of around <strong>£60,000</strong>. That profit could help fund future festivals or even be donated to schools and community groups for <strong>music education</strong>. The dream, however, is to make the <strong>first year free</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="music-line-up-hopes">Music line-up hopes</h2>
<p>The organisers are already exploring acts, with bands such as <strong>The Pigeon Detectives, Bastille, and Sam Ryder</strong> within the projected budget.<br />
The plan is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the <strong>main stage with Carnival</strong> to cut costs.<br />
</li>
<li>Keep <strong>Carnival stalls on site</strong> to add to the atmosphere.<br />
</li>
<li>Run a schedule with <strong>main acts on Friday and Saturday nights</strong>, and smaller performances closing out Sunday afternoon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions-from-councillors">Questions from councillors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: Some funds had previously been set aside for the old Monmouth Music Festival, but the Town Clerk confirmed no budget currently exists for the new event. Support might be reconsidered later or added into the <strong>2026/27 budget</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Permissions</strong>: Concerns were raised over the need for official permission to use Chippenham Mead, which will require discussions with <strong>Monmouthshire County Council</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these hurdles, councillors agreed they were enthusiastic about the idea and asked Jones to return with <strong>confirmed permissions, detailed costings, and further talks with the Monmouth Music Festival committee</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="carnivals-musical-momentum">Carnival’s musical momentum</h2>
<p>The announcement comes hot on the heels of the Carnival’s <strong>Battle of the Bands</strong>, held on Sunday 29th June 2025.</p>
<p>From <strong>60 hopeful bands</strong>, six made it through to the final showdown — including Leeds-based <strong>Fake Fame</strong>, Cardiff’s <strong>Four Act Riot</strong>, and Aberystwyth favourites <strong>Misha and the Kings</strong>. Local young talent also shone with school band <strong>HZRD</strong> and sibling trio <strong>Hillsy</strong> impressing the crowd.</p>
<p>The competition climaxed with a <strong>headline set from Kira Mac</strong>, whose powerhouse frontwoman Rhiannon even offered two lucky bands the chance to <strong>support them on tour</strong>. The atmosphere was electric, leaving many convinced that Monmouth is ready for something bigger.</p>
<p>With community backing, the Carnival organisers believe a <strong>new festival could put Monmouth firmly back on the live music map</strong>. All eyes now turn to the council’s autumn budget discussions and the ongoing talks with Monmouthshire County Council.</p>]]></description>

<title>Ellie Chowns takes on Starmer, new Green leader under fire</title>

<guid>https://freebooter.uk/posts/ellie-chowns-takes-on-starmer,-new-green-leader-under-fire.html</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Ellie Chowns, Green Party MP for North Herefordshire, went head-to-head with Prime Minister Kier Starmer over climate policy today (3 September 2025).</p>
<p>Chowns slammed the Conservatives’ plans to extract more oil and gas from the North Sea, calling it “reckless” and useless for energy security or jobs. Turning to Starmer, she asked if he would finally put a stop to the controversial Rosebank oil project, reminding him that climate action is supposed to be at the heart of his government’s mission.</p>
<p>Rather than answering the question, Starmer fired back, pointing the finger at the Greens. He criticized the party’s plans in Scotland, claiming they could threaten £50 billion in renewable energy investment and secure jobs.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also blasted the Green Party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, accusing him of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting withdrawal from NATO at a sensitive time<br />
</li>
<li>Proposing unfunded spending that could harm the economy<br />
</li>
<li>Blocking all planning applications<br />
</li>
<li>Making “very strange” comments about women</li>
</ul>
<p>Starmer claims Labour is the only party tackling the climate crisis while delivering fairness to the country.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-zach-polanski">Who is Zach Polanski?</h2>
<p>Zack Polanski has been elected leader of the Green Party, promising bold communication and a new “eco-populism” approach. He told Labour, “We are here to replace you,” signaling his intent to challenge Sir Keir Starmer’s party directly.</p>
<p>Polanski, 42, is well-known among Green Party members for his media appearances but remains little known outside the London Assembly, where he is an elected member. He beat two of the party’s four MPs to take the leadership, despite questions about his lack of experience in the traditional parliamentary system.</p>
<p>His leadership pitch focused on moving the party decisively to the left and adopting a more confrontational style of communication.</p>
<p>Polanski has had an unconventional path into politics, previously working as an actor, hypnotherapist, and mental health counsellor. A 2013 article in the Sun, which claimed he helped a client enhance her bust through hypnotherapy, continues to follow him. Polanski said this was before his political career, and he immediately apologised, adding, “We are all more than one mistake.”</p>
<p>Born in 1982 in Salford, Polanski studied at Aberystwyth University in Wales before moving to Hackney, east London. He is openly gay and Jewish, and changed his name from David Paulden at 18 to embrace his heritage and differentiate from his stepfather.</p>
<p>Polanski first entered politics with the Liberal Democrats but now criticizes them for being too centrist. He joined the Greens in 2017, served as a local party chairman, was elected to the London Assembly in 2021, and became the party’s deputy leader in 2022.</p>]]></description>

</li>
<li>Blocking all planning applications<br />
</li>
<li>Making “very strange” comments about women</li>
</ul>
<p>Starmer claims Labour is the only party tackling the climate crisis while delivering fairness to the country.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-zach-polanski">Who is Zach Polanski?</h2>
<p>Zack Polanski has been elected leader of the Green Party, promising bold communication and a new “eco-populism” approach. He told Labour, “We are here to replace you,” signaling his intent to challenge Sir Keir Starmer’s party directly.</p>
<p>Polanski, 42, is well-known among Green Party members for his media appearances but remains little known outside the London Assembly, where he is an elected member. He beat two of the party’s four MPs to take the leadership, despite questions about his lack of experience in the traditional parliamentary system.</p>
<p>His leadership pitch focused on moving the party decisively to the left and adopting a more confrontational style of communication.</p>
<p>Polanski has had an unconventional path into politics, previously working as an actor, hypnotherapist, and mental health counsellor. A 2013 article in the Sun, which claimed he helped a client enhance her bust through hypnotherapy, continues to follow him. Polanski said this was before his political career, and he immediately apologised, adding, “We are all more than one mistake.”</p>
<p>Born in 1982 in Salford, Polanski studied at Aberystwyth University in Wales before moving to Hackney, east London. He is openly gay and Jewish, and changed his name from David Paulden at 18 to embrace his heritage and differentiate from his stepfather.</p>
<p>Polanski first entered politics with the Liberal Democrats but now criticizes them for being too centrist. He joined the Greens in 2017, served as a local party chairman, was elected to the London Assembly in 2021, and became the party’s deputy leader in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Lydney Council mows down opposition in unanimous decision to purchase mighty Kubota F391</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It was the kind of council debate that could make or break the lawns of Lydney for generations to come: should the town invest in a brand-new grass mower? After much deliberation (and, one assumes, a few wistful glances out at Bathurst Park’s expansive greenery), councillors voted unanimously to approve a five-year hire purchase agreement for the Kubota F391 Outfront Mower — a machine so powerful it could probably shave a cricket pitch into a snooker table if asked politely.</p>
<p><img src="https://fjs.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/F-391_Studio_side8.jpg" alt="Kubota F391 Outfront Mower" /></p>
<p>Head Gardener James, the unsung hero of the town’s grassy horizons, presented his case for the 37-horsepower diesel beast. No longer would the council’s green team have to wrestle with outdated kit; now, they would be armed with hydrostatic all-wheel-drive, LED headlights, and — perhaps most importantly — a 72-inch cutting deck capable of chewing through unruly tufts faster than you can say “mulching efficiency.”</p>
<p>The Kubota F391, described in the manufacturer’s blurb as “the efficiency machine,” promises not only to keep Lydney’s parks trim and proper but also to deliver an “excellent power-to-cost ratio.” In plain English: it’s expensive, yes, but it cuts grass very, very well.</p>
<p>Councillors were suitably impressed. “This mower doesn’t just cut grass, it defines a town,” one might imagine a councillor saying as visions of perfectly striped verges danced before their eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, in the age of accountability, the mower’s movements will not go unmonitored. Alongside the purchase, the council requested costings on fitting GPS trackers to all council vehicles, including this new leviathan of lawn care. After all, nobody wants to wake up one morning to find the pride of Lydney Council joyriding through Coleford.</p>
<p>While the finer points of mulching quality, ergonomic operator platforms, and puncture-proof support wheels may not capture the imagination of every resident, there is little doubt that the decision will have visible consequences. From Bathurst Park to the Mesne, Lydney’s green spaces look set to be manicured with precision that would make even Wimbledon’s groundskeepers blush.</p>
<p>The verdict is in: the Kubota F391 is coming to town. And while it may not solve traffic problems, planning disputes, or the eternal saga of community asset listings, at least the grass will look immaculate while those debates rage on.</p>]]></description>

<title>Forest MP hits out at court backlogs and calls for reform</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has warned that tackling the growing Crown Court backlog requires more than simply adding sitting days—it needs fundamental reform, during a commons debate (3 July).</p>
<p>“With the Crown Court backlog that we inherited at such high levels, and continuing to rise, does the Minister agree that tackling it means not just adding more sitting days but making fundamental reform?” Bishop asked.</p>
<p>The Minister of State for Justice, Sarah Sackman, agreed the situation is intolerable. She described record backlogs in the criminal courts as having a serious human impact on victims, witnesses, and court staff, and said radical structural reform is needed alongside increased sitting days. Sackman cited the forthcoming work of Sir Brian Leveson and the Ministry’s £450 million investment in courts as part of efforts to restore confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Other MPs also spoke during the debate. Conservative Ashley Fox warned that increasing early guilty plea discounts to 40% could undermine trust in the system, and questioned proposals for an “intermediate court” aimed at speeding up cases. Sackman said the courts’ priority is delivering swift justice, not cost-saving.</p>
<p>Emily Thornberry, drawing on 20 years’ experience as a barrister, said delays in Crown courts have led some defendants to plead “not guilty” knowing their case would take years to reach trial. Sackman responded that reform will consider new technologies and efficiencies while maintaining the integrity of jury trials.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds shared his personal experience as a juror, highlighting that jurors are often underused. Sackman said the issue is overall system capacity—judges, lawyers, courtrooms, and resources—not the jury system itself.</p>
<p>Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell and Uma Kumaran, stressed the importance of restoring public confidence, particularly for victims of crime. Kumaran highlighted that under the previous Conservative government, 60% of rape victims withdrew their cases due to delays. Sackman emphasised that victims must see timely justice, and investment in victims’ services is a key part of reforms.</p>
<p>Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts warned that removing jury rights for sentences under two years in an intermediate court would not address years of underfunding and staff shortages in magistrates courts. Sackman said the government aims for whole-system reform, respecting the local role of magistrates courts while tackling the backlog across the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Other MPs, including Christopher Vince, noted the effects of previous court closures on victims’ confidence, echoing calls for fundamental reform. Sackman reiterated that the government is committed to restoring the system, ensuring that victims receive timely justice, and addressing the backlog comprehensively.</p>]]></description>

<title>Forest of Dean Freeminers’ rights protected in Government coal plans</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has pressed the government on its plans to restrict new coal mining licences, asking how his department will protect the unique rights of local Freeminers (7 July 2025).</p>
<p>Mister Bishop asked the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero what progress had been made on legislative proposals to amend the Coal Industry Act 1994, ensuring that new coal extraction licences would be prohibited, while safeguarding Freeminers’ centuries-old rights.</p>
<p>Michael Shanks, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed that the government intends to introduce the legislation “as soon as possible.” He reassured that the historic rights of Freeminers in the Forest of Dean will be fully exempted, allowing them to continue mining under their traditional rules.</p>
<p>Freemining is a rare and historic custom, dating back to 1244. To become a Freeminer, an individual must be born and bred within the “Hundred of St Briavels,” be at least 21 years old, and have worked a year and a day in a mine. Registered Freeminers are entitled to mine personal plots, known as gales. Since the 1840s, more than 4,300 Freeminers have been registered, and in 2010 women were included for the first time.</p>
<p>Mining has shaped the Forest of Dean for centuries and continues to influence local life. Notably, the Forest of Dean Cycle Centre is built on a former colliery site, with the old mine’s terrain providing ideal conditions for downhill trails.</p>
<p>Bishop said he welcomed the government’s commitment, highlighting the importance of protecting the Forest’s historic mining traditions while moving forward with modern energy policy.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouth MP Catherine Fookes defends Labour's autumn budget</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouth MP <strong>Catherine Fookes</strong> has defended Labour’s autumn budget, and how it impacts Welsh farmers.</p>
<p>Speaking on <strong>16 July 2025</strong>, Fookes pointed out that the <strong>Welsh Government’s budget contains over £300 million</strong> to support farmers and accused Plaid Cymru and the Tories were putting farmers’ livelihoods at risk by voting against the funding.</p>
<p>The debate focused on the potential impact of the <strong>autumn budget 2024</strong> on Welsh family farms. The Minister for Wales, <strong>Nia Griffith</strong>, confirmed that the Government had <strong>protected the farm budget</strong> and allocated <strong>£337 million</strong> to the Welsh Government. Griffith also highlighted a new <strong>UK-EU agrifood deal</strong>, which will remove routine border checks on British goods such as dairy, fish, eggs, and red meat, reducing costs and paperwork for farmers.</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised about the <strong>Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS)</strong>, a government plan aimed at promoting environmentally friendly farming. While the scheme has a <strong>transition period</strong> and a <strong>basic payment scheme</strong> for those not yet in the program, some farmers have expressed worries about its complexity and potential impact on production. Griffith noted that the scheme provides “workable payment rates and much needed stability for the sector.”</p>
<p>The <strong>National Farmers’ Union (NFU)</strong> has warned that planned changes to the <strong>family farm inheritance tax</strong> could disproportionately affect working farms, according to a new report by the <strong>Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax)</strong>.</p>
<p>The report, titled <em>“The impact of changes to inheritance tax on farm estates”</em>, uses <strong>HMRC data from 2018-2022</strong> to examine the government’s proposed reforms to <strong>Agricultural Property Relief (APR)</strong> and <strong>Business Property Relief (BPR)</strong>. It found that <strong>around 480 farm estates a year</strong> would pay additional tax, with <strong>50% of owner-farmers, tenant farmers, and mixed tenure farmers</strong> impacted. Non-farming landowners would be less affected, with only 20% facing higher tax.</p>
<p>NFU President <strong>Tom Bradshaw</strong> said the proposals “do little to counter those who seek to shelter wealth from inheritance tax by investing in farmland” and called for <strong>fairer targeting</strong> to protect working farms. He welcomed CenTax’s analysis as a chance for “fresh conversations” with the government ahead of the Finance Bill.</p>
<p>The report also highlighted <strong>affordability issues</strong>. Most impacted farm estates could pay through non-farm assets, but <strong>70 estates per year</strong> could not, and would need to use future profits over 10 years. Impacted estates were generally held by older owners, with over <strong>80% aged 75 and above</strong>.</p>
<p>CenTax proposed several <strong>alternatives</strong> to better support working farms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum share rule</strong>: APR and BPR qualifying assets must make up at least 60% of net worth to qualify for higher relief, aiming to separate working farmers from investors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Upper limit on relief</strong>: 100% relief on the first £2m of assets, then 50% up to £10m, with no relief above that.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Combination of both</strong>: Higher allowances for working farms while limiting relief for larger estates.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to CenTax, these alternatives could <strong>raise more tax revenue</strong> than the government’s current proposal while <strong>better protecting working farmers</strong>.</p>
<p>The NFU is urging the government to use this analysis to ensure <strong>fairness and affordability</strong> in the upcoming reforms.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouth MP makes case for Magor and Undy station in Commons debate</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes made a strong case in the House of Commons (8 July 2025) for a new station at Magor and Undy, highlighting its potential to transform local transport and open up jobs for residents without cars. Speaking during a debate on road and rail projects, Fookes welcomed the Government’s “ramped up” spending and the £445 million earmarked for Wales in the recent spending review.</p>
<p>Fookes argued that the Magor and Undy station could reduce congestion on the M4 while giving people without cars better access to employment opportunities. She suggested that the site could be an ideal candidate for one of the first five “Burns stations,” thanks to existing track and infrastructure already in place.</p>
<p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander praised Fookes for her advocacy, describing her as “a fearsome champion” for the station. Alexander confirmed the £445 million would be spread over the next ten years to correct historic underinvestment in Welsh rail and said the Wales Rail Board would set priorities to ensure communities like Fookes’ benefit from the funding.</p>
<p>The debate also saw Plaid Cymru MP Ann Davies raise concerns that the £445 million would cover just five stations, leaving areas west of Cardiff, such as St Clears, without support despite long-standing promises. Alexander defended the funding, describing it as a “step change” for Welsh rail, covering both development projects and new infrastructure across south and north Wales, and offered to discuss specific local schemes further.</p>
<p>Fookes’ intervention highlighted the importance of investing in local transport links to both tackle congestion and improve access to jobs. Her call for Magor and Undy to become an early Burns station signals a potential turning point for the region’s transport network, promising tangible benefits for residents and local commuters alike.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A growing national project is opening up new opportunities for walkers in the <strong>Wye Valley and Forest of Dean</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://slowways.org">Slow Ways</a>, a non-profit initiative, is building a walking network that connects every town, city, and national landscape in Britain. The idea is, if people know there’s a safe and clear way to walk somewhere, they’re more likely to do it.</p>
<p>Started in 2020 by geographer <strong>Dan Raven-Ellison</strong>, Slow Ways has grown with the help of thousands of volunteers. Together they have created nearly <strong>10,000 routes</strong> linking over <strong>2,500 places</strong>. Many of these walks pass through or connect to our area – from the <strong>market towns of the Forest of Dean</strong> to the villages and riverside paths of the <strong>Wye Valley</strong>.</p>
<p>The Slow Ways routes are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be safe, direct, and accessible</li>
<li>Avoid busy roads where possible</li>
<li>Include resting places every 5–10 km</li>
<li>Pass through public transport hubs</li>
<li>Be enjoyable and easy to follow</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every path is suitable for everyone, but routes are tested by walkers and wheelchair/scooter users. Reviews, star ratings, and surveys help highlight surface quality, gradients, and obstacles like stiles or mud. Routes with three or more positive reviews become “verified” – tried and tested by the community.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is about more than just hiking. It encourages people to walk or wheel for everyday journeys, like visiting friends, shopping, or commuting, as well as for longer adventures.</p>
<p>You can explore the routes through the <strong>Slow Ways website</strong>, their iOS and Android apps, or printed maps and atlases. Each walk comes with practical advice and friendly tips from other walkers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is powered by citizens, not governments – although the team hopes local and national authorities will support and invest in the future of walking.</p>
<p>Their long-term vision is for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong> – safe and inclusive routes for all abilities</li>
<li><strong>Everywhere</strong> – a walking network as simple to use as the road system</li>
<li><strong>Every day</strong> – walking and wheeling as natural parts of daily life</li>
<li><strong>Every time</strong> – reliable paths, with data to give confidence before setting out</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to explore or contribute to this growing network, visit <a href="https://slowways.org">slowways.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can also share your own experiences, review routes, and help verify paths in the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean. Every contribution makes a difference – strengthening a network that connects people to nature, to each other, and to the wider world.</p>
<p>For help, you can contact the Slow Ways team at <strong>hello@slowways.org</strong> or find them on social media, including Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, X, and LinkedIn. Issues can be reported to <strong>support@slowways.zendesk.com</strong>.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council is asking residents to share their views on how the county manages flood risk. A public consultation is now open on the council’s draft <strong>Local Flood Risk Management Strategy</strong>, which sets out plans for the next six years.</p>
<p>The consultation runs from <strong>Friday 1 August until Friday 26 September, 2025</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-consultation-about">What’s the consultation about?</h2>
<p>The draft strategy explains how the council plans to deal with flooding from surface water, groundwater and smaller local rivers and streams. It builds on the county’s first flood strategy from 2013 and takes into account lessons from recent major floods, new legislation and national policy changes.</p>
<p>Residents are being asked to give feedback on the proposals, either online or by filling in a paper survey available from their nearest Community Hub. The council says local experiences are vital to shaping its plans.</p>
<h2 id="drop-in-events">Drop-in events</h2>
<p>People can also speak to officers in person at drop-in sessions across the county:</p>

</li>
<li><strong>Caldicot Community Hub</strong> – Thursday 11 September, 9am–5pm</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h2>
<p>Once the consultation closes, the council will review the feedback and update the strategy. The final version will go to the Cabinet for approval before being sent to the Welsh Government. The council expects to publish an update later in <strong>late 2025 or early 2026</strong>.</p>

<title>UK justice system faces urgent reforms amid backlogs and calls to protect jury trials</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The House of Commons heard extensive debate (9 July) on the state of the UK criminal justice system, as MPs pressed the Government on backlogs, court delays, and the future of jury trials. The discussion followed the release of Sir Brian Leveson’s report, which called for once-in-a-generation reforms to improve efficiency and ensure timely justice.</p>
<p>Labour MPs highlighted the human cost of the backlog, noting that under the previous Conservative Government, 60% of rape victims abandoned their cases due to lengthy delays. Minister of State for Justice Sarah Sackman acknowledged the scale of the problem, emphasizing investment in victims’ services, the strengthening of the Victims’ Code, and the critical need for timely trials.</p>
<p>Local justice concerns were raised by Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts, who pointed to underfunding, court closures, and staff shortages affecting magistrates courts. Sackman confirmed the Government would pursue whole-system reforms rather than piecemeal changes, while noting that investments had already been made to maintain and improve court infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sackman defended the Government’s record on prison investment, noting that 14,000 new prison places had been committed alongside sentencing reforms and £450 million allocated to courts. She stressed that additional Crown Court sitting days—over 4,000 more than previously agreed—were part of the effort to tackle delays, but structural reform remained essential.</p>
<p>The debate also focused on the role of jury trials. Concerns were raised about any potential erosion of the right to a jury, with MPs warning that such changes could undermine public confidence. Sackman repeatedly reassured the House that jury trials would remain central for serious cases, while noting that Sir Brian Leveson’s recommendations emphasized proportionate reforms to ensure timely justice. She argued that the current system’s delays, not trial format, posed the greatest threat to both victims and defendants.</p>
<p>Questions were also raised about plea bargaining, with opposition MPs urging the Government to rule out reducing sentences by up to 40% for guilty pleas—a practice common in the United States. Sackman confirmed the Government had no intention of replicating the US system and emphasized careful policy development to balance swifter justice with public protection.</p>
<p>Some MPs suggested adopting practices from other jurisdictions, including intensive supervision courts and faster hearings for domestic abuse cases. Sackman said the Government would consider lessons from abroad, alongside preventive interventions and rehabilitation programs, to reduce reoffending and relieve court backlogs.</p>
<p>The debate underscored a shared recognition across parties that the UK criminal justice system is at a critical juncture. Sackman stressed that reform, investment, and engagement with legal professionals would be central to addressing backlogs, protecting victims, and maintaining public confidence in both jury trials and the wider judicial process.</p>]]></description>

<title>Ambitious plans for Five Acres laid out by council</title>

<pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The Forest of Dean District Council has unveiled an ambitious new vision for <strong>Five Acres</strong> in Berry Hill, creating a hub of leisure, education, and community activities for residents across the district. The project is designed to bring people together, provide modern facilities, and support the health and wellbeing of the local community.</p>
<h2 id="phase-one-indoor-facilities-and-community-spaces">Phase one: indoor facilities and community spaces</h2>
<p>The first phase of the redevelopment focuses on the <strong>refurbishment of the former Speedwell Building</strong> and the creation of new indoor leisure facilities. Plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>large 53-station gym</strong> for all ages and abilities<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Power-assisted exercise rooms</strong> and group exercise space<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Soft play areas</strong> and party rooms for children<br />
</li>
<li>A <strong>café</strong> for visitors<br />
</li>
<li>Repurposed upper floors of the Speedwell Building for <strong>office and community space</strong><br />
</li>
<li>A dedicated <strong>outreach space for Hartpury University’s Aspiration Centre</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>New car parking</strong> and a secure <strong>cycle parking facility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The designs have been carefully developed with input from residents and community groups, ensuring that the facilities meet local needs while remaining <strong>financially and environmentally sustainable</strong>. Energy-efficient features such as <strong>air source heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, and electric vehicle charging points</strong> are included to ensure a long-term positive impact.</p>
<h2 id="phase-two-outdoor-sports-facilities">Phase two: outdoor sports facilities</h2>
<p>The second phase focuses on the <strong>3G artificial pitch</strong>, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full-size pitch</strong> suitable for football and rugby training and competitive games<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Floodlights and spectator area</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Compliance with <strong>World Rugby Reg22 standards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This phase is part of a successful funding bid to the <strong>Football Association</strong> in January 2025. A <strong>planning application (P0087/25/FUL)</strong> has been submitted and is under consideration.</p>
<p>The pitch location has been carefully chosen due to site constraints such as a capped mining shaft and tree root protection zones. It is designed to meet the growing demand for 3G pitches in the district, which currently has a shortfall of two full-size pitches for local teams.</p>
<h2 id="future-expansion-and-flexibility">Future expansion and flexibility</h2>
<p>Although the initial plans do not include a swimming pool or new tennis courts, the design leaves <strong>space for future expansion</strong>. The Sports Hall has been reoriented, and corridors included to allow for potential future facilities without disrupting current operations.</p>
<p>A <strong>small performance venue</strong> will be included in the Sports Hall, allowing for exhibitions, static displays, or live performances. Retractable bleacher seating for up to 450 people could be added in future phases if funding becomes available.</p>
<p>The athletics track, owned by Five Acres High School, could be upgraded in the future with support from the council and advice from England Athletics.</p>
<h2 id="education-and-community-partnerships">Education and community partnerships</h2>
<p>Hartpury University and College will <strong>lease two rooms</strong> within the refurbished Speedwell Building for its <strong>Aspiration Centre</strong>, creating a local outreach hub. This centre will provide programmes and activities aimed at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising aspirations among young people in the Forest of Dean<br />
</li>
<li>Promoting further and higher education opportunities<br />
</li>
<li>Supporting business and employer pathways</li>
</ul>
<p>The partnership with Hartpury also aims to <strong>reduce travel and carbon emissions</strong> for students by bringing education closer to home.</p>
<h2 id="funding-and-redevelopment">Funding and redevelopment</h2>
<p>The redevelopment is being funded by the council through a <strong>successful Levelling Up Fund bid</strong>, which also supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>flagship University, Careers &amp; Enterprise Learning Centre</strong> and electric vehicle car park at Hartpury<br />
</li>
<li>Transformation of <strong>three prominent buildings in Cinderford town centre</strong> to support businesses, social enterprises, training, and the arts</li>
</ul>
<p>The council purchased the Five Acres site from <strong>Homes England in December 2021 for £1</strong>, with the goal of creating a new council-owned leisure and community destination. Demolition of the previous structures has been completed, and the site is now cleared and ready for construction.</p>
<h2 id="community-consultation">Community consultation</h2>
<p>Early consultation events were held at <strong>Berry Hill Primary School</strong> and <strong>Five Acres High School</strong>, helping shape the phased design approach. Further community information events will be organised as the project progresses, keeping residents updated on plans for both indoor and outdoor facilities.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</h2>
<p>The council’s vision for Five Acres is to create a <strong>hub for community activity</strong> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sports and leisure facilities for all ages<br />
</li>
<li>Spaces for socialising and community groups<br />
</li>
<li>Opportunities for small businesses to start or grow<br />
</li>
<li>Potential for a hotel to support local tourism in future phases</li>
</ul>
<p>The project aligns with the <strong>Allocations Plan</strong> and the <strong>Berry Hill, Christchurch, and Edge End Neighbourhood Plan</strong>, ensuring it meets local planning and community objectives.</p>
<h2 id="key-facts-about-facilities">Key facts about facilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swimming pool</strong>: No current plans due to lack of funding. Space is reserved for future development.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Tennis courts</strong>: Currently in poor condition; future upgrades will depend on user demand and funding. Multi-use options for basketball or netball may be considered.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>3G pitch</strong>: Designed for full-size football and rugby, with planned community use from 5-9pm weekdays and potential daytime school use.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Sports Hall</strong>: Multi-purpose space for badminton, football, or community events, with flexible line markings and potential retractable seating.</li>

<title>Monmouth Raft Race faces uncertain future as River Wye runs low</title>
<link>https://freebooter.uk/posts/monmouth-raft-race-faces-uncertain-future-as-river-wye-runs-low.html</link>
<guid>https://freebooter.uk/posts/monmouth-raft-race-faces-uncertain-future-as-river-wye-runs-low.html</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The 58th Monmouth Raft Race could be in jeopardy this year as the drought-hit River Wye continues to struggle with extremely low water levels. Organisers are monitoring the situation closely and plan to make a final decision on Sunday 31 August.</p>
<p>Norman Williams, who has run the raft race for the past 22 years, said:
“At the moment it’s difficult to say what is happening. We will watch the weather and have a meeting this Sunday, August 31. At present we have 45 entrants all hoping to raise money for good causes. We sincerely hope that the event can go ahead. Perhaps praying for rain is our last hope?”</p>
<p>The low water levels pose several challenges. Around 400 yards of the course may only be navigable by dragging or carrying rafts over the stony riverbed, creating safety risks, especially for heavier rafts. Crews are being advised to keep rafts as light as possible and ensure they have the physical capability to handle these tricky sections.</p>
<p>The river is also flowing slowly, meaning participants will need extra effort to complete the six-mile course. Beyond the practical concerns, there are environmental worries. The Wye is a vital habitat currently under stress, with high river temperatures threatening fish populations, according to Natural Resources Wales. Holding the race could disturb the wildlife and damage the riverbed in these fragile conditions.</p>
<p>If the race is cancelled, entry fees will be refunded, though organisers are encouraging participants to consider donating their fees to St David’s Hospice Care, a Gwent-based charity providing free, at-home care to patients with life-threatening illnesses. The same option is available to those who withdraw voluntarily.</p>
<p>The race is scheduled to start at noon on Sunday 7 September from Monmouth Rowing Club, following a 6.5-mile route down the Wye to Tump Farm, Whitebrook, where a family festival with entertainment and refreshments awaits. Participants are encouraged to seek sponsorship from employers or local pubs, combining team-building fun with support for a worthy cause.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouthshire set for biggest-ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning</title>

<guid>https://freebooter.uk/posts/monmouthshire-set-for-biggest-ever-fairtrade-coffee-morning.html</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire schools and community groups are being invited to take part in the county’s largest-ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning during this year’s Fairtrade Fortnight, running from 22 September to 5 October.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to raise awareness not just of the social impact of Fairtrade, but also its environmental benefits. Coffee production can contribute to tropical deforestation, but Fairtrade-certified coffee guarantees that farmers are paid a fair price while ensuring that native forests remain protected.</p>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council and local Fairtrade Town groups are encouraging schools and community groups to host their own coffee morning at a time that suits them during the Fortnight. Participating schools will receive Fairtrade coffee for their staff rooms and can take part in a free online, interactive lesson from the charity Size of Wales, which explores the link between coffee and tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Some lucky schools will also have the chance to win extra treats, including a Fairtrade chocolate brownie-making workshop or a visit from a Ugandan coffee farmer, who will share how Fairtrade has positively impacted her community.</p>
<p>Councillor Catrin Maby, Cabinet Member for Climate and Environment, said:
“More and more people know now about the difference that buying Fairtrade makes to the lives of growers and producers, but not so many people are aware of the environmental benefits that Fairtrade brings. That’s why we want lots of schools and groups to get involved in the biggest ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning to help get the message out there!”</p>
<p>Schools and community groups can register to take part by contacting hazelclatworthy@monmouthshire.gov.uk.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouth motorcyclist and social media personality <a href="https://thegirlonabike.com">Vanessa Ruck</a> – widely known as The Girl on a Bike – has released her guide to what she describes as the “ultimate one-day motorcycle trip in the UK,” starting and finishing in the Wye Valley.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/thegirlonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the_girl_on_a_bike_triumph_tiger-900-rally-pro-touring-19-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Vanessa Ruck on a Tiger 900" /></p>
<p>The route showcases some of the area’s best riding roads, including the A466 from Chepstow to Monmouth, the B4235, the A4136 towards Symonds Yat, and a return stretch along the River Wye. The ride is designed to highlight both the scenery and the wealth of local stop-offs that make the valley such a draw for visitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3B7rF9i_hQ">Watch the video of her journey</a>.</p>
<p>Among the suggested breaks are Monmouth’s historic high street and picnic area, the Lion Inn at Trellech, and Symonds Yat Rock with its panoramic views across the valley.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monmouth motorcyclist and social media personality <a href="https://thegirlonabike.com">Vanessa Ruck</a> – widely known as The Girl on a Bike – has released her guide to what she describes as the “ultimate one-day motorcycle trip in the UK,” starting and finishing in the Wye Valley.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/thegirlonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the_girl_on_a_bike_triumph_tiger-900-rally-pro-touring-19-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Vanessa Ruck on a Tiger 900" /></p>
<p>The route showcases some of the area’s best riding roads, including the A466 from Chepstow to Monmouth, the B4235, the A4136 towards Symonds Yat, and a return stretch along the River Wye. The ride is designed to highlight both the scenery and the wealth of local stop-offs that make the valley such a draw for visitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3B7rF9i_hQ">Watch the video of her journey</a>.</p>
<p>Among the suggested breaks are Monmouth’s historic high street and picnic area, the Lion Inn at Trellech, and Symonds Yat Rock with its panoramic views across the valley. Other recommended stops include Tintern Abbey, the Old Station Tintern, and Bigsweir Bridge – one of the most photographed crossings of the River Wye.</p>

<title>Tree felling and historic renovations given green light by council</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide range of planning applications in recent weeks, covering tree maintenance, removals, property renovations, and historic building repairs. The decisions highlight the council’s ongoing efforts to balance safety, preservation, and modern living needs across the county.</p>
<h2 id="tree-works">Tree works</h2>
<p>In Abergavenny, five trees at 15 Wedgwood Gardens will undergo maintenance. Two ash trees suffering from ash dieback will be reduced to monoliths to encourage regeneration, while two further ash trees leaning over Hillside Road will have overhanging branches removed and crowns thinned to improve safety. A sweet chestnut will also have branches overhanging the road removed.</p>
<p>In Caldicot, approval was granted for the removal of a single conifer at 45 Church Road. Meanwhile, at 34 Woodside, Llanbadoc, a leylandi and a conifer on the driveway side of the property will be removed.</p>
<p>At Silver How, Llanhennock, multiple trees will undergo works including crown reductions, removal of deadwood, and felling of dead or diseased trees such as ash, elm, and beech. Several oak trees will have crown lifting and removal of excessive growth to ensure safety and improve long-term health.</p>
<p>In Chepstow, two mature walnut trees at Crossways Farm will have crowns thinned by up to 20% and lower limbs removed where they overhang the pavement and driveway.</p>
<p>Other approved tree works include shaping and reduction of cherry and hawthorn trees at Applecross Cottage, Mathern, felling of a Magnolia at Masonic Hall, Monmouth, and a 30% crown reduction of a Sycamore at 9 Company Farm Drive, Llanfoist.</p>
<p>At Bushes Farm, Chapel Road, Earlswood, Shirenewton, the council approved the discharge of Condition 8 linked to a previous planning decision, allowing tree-related works on the site to proceed in line with approved plans.</p>
<h2 id="property-renovations-and-historic-building-works">Property renovations and historic building works</h2>
<p>At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent. The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the timber cupola, a small decorative structure on top of the main roof that provides ventilation and adds architectural character to the historic house. The restoration will preserve this key architectural feature while ensuring it remains safe and functional.</p>
<p>In Grosmont, modifications to a previous approval at Broome Villa, Hand Road were approved. The works involve extending, improving, and remodelling the detached house and outbuildings, alongside creating a new vehicular access and parking area, modernising the property while maintaining harmony with the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>At Merrig Mill, Tregagle, Trellech, a series of renovations and small-scale construction projects were approved. These include converting a single-storey stone outbuilding, formerly used as a stable, into a bedroom and shower room, constructing a new small stable attached to the ancillary barn, and renovating an existing barn within the domestic curtilage for personal residential use.</p>
<p>All applications were validated and decided between 26 and 27 August 2025.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A retrospective bid to keep two illuminated fascia signs at a popular Abergavenny restaurant has divided opinion — with planning officers recommending refusal but councillors voting to defer a final decision.</p>
<p>The application, lodged by Mr Peter Woolley for <strong>Il Gusto</strong> at <strong>43 Frogmore Street</strong>, sought to retain two internally illuminated signs already installed on the shopfront. The site lies in the <strong>Abergavenny Conservation Area</strong>, within the town’s historic core and close to several listed buildings, including the Baptist Church and the War Memorial.</p>
<p>The planning meeting where this was decided can be viewed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=EBiA2bO-4m65F3Xq&amp;t=5329">YouTube</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h2>
<p>The two fascia signs, each around 3 metres wide and 0.6 metres high, feature <strong>white text on a black PVC background</strong>. They are static, internally lit, with a brightness of <strong>300 cd/m²</strong>, and sit above the restaurant frontage at a height of 2.65 metres.</p>
<p>The application is <strong>retrospective</strong>, as the signs have already been fitted without formal consent. Earlier permissions for the site (2015) had allowed only <strong>externally illuminated signage</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-the-signs">Support for the signs</h2>
<p>The application has received <strong>12 neighbour comments</strong>, all supportive. Local residents and customers described the signs as <em>“tasteful”</em>, <em>“elegant”</em>, and <em>“in keeping with the town’s character”</em>.</p>
<p>Supporters argued the signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help small businesses stand out in the evening economy</li>
<li>Contribute to a vibrant town centre</li>
<li>Are no brighter than existing signage, including Tesco opposite</li>
<li>Compare favourably to other national chains that have been granted internally lit signs in Abergavenny</li>
</ul>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council and the Abergavenny &amp; District Civic Society also backed the application, stressing the need for <strong>consistency</strong> and updated guidance for shopfronts in conservation areas.</p>
<p>Local councillor Laura Wright also weighed in, calling the signage <em>“not problematic within the conservation area”</em>. She said illumination levels were modest, switched off at 10pm, and no different to signage that had been in place at the site for years. <em>“Supporting local businesses in our town centre is vital,”</em> she added.</p>
<h2 id="heritage-and-officer-concerns">Heritage and officer concerns</h2>
<p>Despite this, <strong>Monmouthshire County Council’s heritage officers</strong> strongly opposed the scheme. They argued that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internally illuminated PVC signage is <strong>modern and out of keeping</strong> with the Conservation Area.</li>
<li>Conservation policy favours <strong>matt finishes and traditional materials</strong> like timber.</li>
<li>The shiny finish and internal lighting make the signs <em>“starkly modern”</em> and intrusive against nearby historic shopfronts.</li>
</ul>
<p>They suggested a compromise: disconnecting the internal lights and replacing the glossy fascia with a <strong>matt wrap and external downlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Planning officers echoed these concerns, citing <strong>Local Development Plan policies DES3 and HE3</strong>, which require signage in conservation areas to preserve character. They concluded the signs had a <strong>“detrimental impact”</strong> on the appearance of the historic core, particularly when lit at night.</p>
<h2 id="the-committee-debate">The committee debate</h2>
<p>At committee, officers recommended refusal. But councillors were split. Some argued the rules were being applied too harshly to an independent business, particularly given the presence of other illuminated signage nearby.</p>
<p>When put to the vote, the motion to refuse failed — <strong>5 in favour, 9 against</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, members resolved to <strong>defer</strong> the decision. Officers were asked to negotiate with the applicant’s agent to find a compromise, likely involving adjustments to the finish or lighting method, before bringing the case back with a <strong>recommendation for approval with conditions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2>
<p>The fate of Il Gusto’s signs now hangs in the balance. The restaurant can continue trading with the current signage in place while discussions continue.</p>
<p>If a compromise is agreed, councillors are expected to approve the signs at a future meeting, bringing an end to a row that has highlighted the <strong>tension between conservation rules and the needs of modern businesses</strong> in Abergavenny’s town centre.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A controversial plan to build a bungalow in the back garden of a Park Close home has been given the green light by Monmouthshire County Council, following months of debate and several amendments to the scheme.</p>
<p>The planning meeting can be view on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=oO8eAeFOOeW7ipjL&amp;t=262">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The application sought permission to construct a single-storey property with its own parking and turning space behind 11 Park Close in Abergavenny.</p>
<p>The scheme was first brought before councillors in January, when it faced strong opposition over the narrow three-metre access lane, which fell short of Welsh planning standards. A tied vote in February left the decision hanging, but the applicant later submitted revised plans with improved parking and manoeuvring space, as well as details on drainage and biodiversity measures.</p>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council maintained its objection, raising issues around drainage, biodiversity, and potential access disputes between neighbours. Several local residents also criticised the plan, warning of loss of green space, privacy concerns, and overdevelopment of the area.</p>
<p>Despite these objections, county highways officers withdrew their earlier concerns, concluding that the updated design provided safe access and sufficient parking. Biodiversity officers accepted new measures, including bird boxes, hedgehog-friendly fencing, and landscaping, while flood and drainage specialists confirmed that surface water could be managed through a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS). Archaeologists also noted that the site sits in a sensitive area, requiring mitigation work during construction.</p>
<p>Planning officers recommended approval, highlighting that the bungalow’s design was modest, single-storey, and in keeping with the area, with minimal impact on neighbouring homes. Councillors agreed, granting permission subject to strict conditions — including removal of permitted development rights, landscaping requirements, and a financial contribution towards affordable housing.</p>]]></description>

<pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a new <strong>40mph speed limit</strong> on Staunton Road (A4136) following a detailed engineering assessment and community consultation. The decision was part of the Individual Cabinet Member Decision meeting held on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>The change is aimed at addressing urgent safety concerns on this strategic route, which connects Monmouth to Gloucestershire and carries a variety of vehicles, including heavy goods traffic, with limited alternative routes.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-change-was-needed">Why the change was needed</h2>
<p>An engineering assessment highlighted that the existing speed limit on Staunton Road is <strong>inappropriate for the road’s geometry and traffic conditions</strong>. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>documented collision cluster</strong> between Wyesham and the county boundary, with <strong>five recorded collisions between 2020 and 2023</strong>, including one fatality.<br />
</li>
<li>The road is heavily used by a range of vehicles, some of which are large, including heavy goods vehicles, creating higher safety risks at current speeds.<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>poor road condition</strong> further increases the risk of accidents, making a lower speed limit necessary for safe navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council concluded that a 40mph limit is the safest option for this section of road and will help prevent future collisions.</p>
<h2 id="support-from-local-community">Support from local community</h2>
<p>Monmouth Town Council has expressed support for the proposed TRO. They highlighted that Staunton Road is used by a variety of vehicles, including large vehicles, and that <strong>slower speeds will improve safety for all road users</strong>. The Council also noted that the road’s current condition requires careful navigation, which is better managed under a lower speed limit.</p>
<h2 id="expected-benefits">Expected benefits</h2>
<p>The introduction of the 40mph limit on Staunton Road is expected to have several positive impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved safety for all road users</strong> by reducing the likelihood and severity of collisions.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Health benefits for the community</strong>, as fewer accidents reduce the burden on emergency services and healthcare providers.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency with wider road safety measures</strong> across Monmouthshire, particularly in areas with documented collision clusters such as Staunton Road and the B4235 between Chepstow and Mynydd Bach.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Better traffic management</strong>, particularly for heavy goods vehicles using this strategic route.</li>
</ul>
<p>Council officers noted that these changes are part of a wider programme to create a safer, more consistent speed limit framework across the county and to support sustainable travel where possible.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 40mph speed limit will be formally implemented as part of the Monmouthshire County Council Traffic Regulation, Speed Limits, and Parking Regulations Consolidation Order 2019 (Amendment Order No. 17).<br />
</li>
<li>New signage will be installed, and the TRO will be legally enforceable to ensure compliance.<br />
</li>
<li>Residents and road users are encouraged to observe the new limit and continue reporting safety concerns to the Council.</li>

<title>Llancayo Travellers’ site approved after long dispute over flooding and drainage</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A long-running planning saga at Llancayo, near Usk, has ended with approval for a Travellers’ site — almost a decade after the family first moved onto the land without consent.</p>
<p>The planning meeting was made available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=S9hUGzBfLcEedUlq&amp;t=4178">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council’s planning committee confirmed its decision this summer to allow <strong>four family-related pitches</strong> on land opposite Llancayo House, despite strong opposition from the local community council and some neighbours.</p>
<p>The development will provide each pitch with a static caravan, a touring caravan, and a day/utility room, together with ecological enhancements, new landscaping, and an emergency flood access. A new <strong>biological treatment plant</strong> and drainage system have been designed to address earlier concerns about pollution in the nearby <strong>River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-disputes">A history of disputes</h2>
<p>The Jones and Purcell family, who are from the Gypsy and Traveller community, have lived at the site since 2016. Their first planning application for six pitches was refused later that year, citing its location in open countryside, poor drainage, and highway safety issues.</p>
<p>An enforcement notice was served requiring the family to leave, but appeals to the Planning Inspectorate, the High Court, and the Court of Appeal followed. The family remained on the site throughout.</p>
<p>The latest application scaled back the scheme from six to <strong>four pitches</strong> and dropped earlier proposals for stables and kennels. Officers said this reduction allowed more space for drainage infrastructure and improved the site’s layout.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-scrutiny">Environmental scrutiny</h2>
<p>Because the site drains towards the River Usk, the proposal triggered a full <strong>Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA)</strong>. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) warned that untreated effluent could damage protected fish species, including twaite and allis shad.</p>
<p>To meet strict rules on phosphates, the family’s agents submitted a detailed <strong>Nutrient Neutrality Assessment and Mitigation Strategy</strong>. This proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>GRAF One2Clean biological treatment plant</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>limestone filter bed</strong> to further strip out phosphorus</li>
<li>A <strong>drainage field</strong> of at least 250m², tested to show the ground can absorb wastewater</li>
</ul>
<p>The system was designed for up to 16–18 people — more than the likely occupancy of 12 across the four pitches — giving what officers called <em>“a comfortable margin of safety.”</em></p>
<p>NRW eventually accepted the calculations, concluding that, with conditions in place, the project would <strong>not harm the River Usk SAC</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="objections-and-concerns">Objections and concerns</h2>
<p>Despite the technical approvals, <strong>Llanarth Fawr Community Council</strong> lodged strong objections. It argued that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drainage field is too small and sits on heavy mudstone that could lead to effluent runoff</li>
<li>The site is close to flood zones, with the emergency escape route itself predicted to flood in a 1-in-100 year event</li>
<li>The layout does not meet all safety standards in Welsh Government guidance for Traveller sites</li>
</ul>
<p>The council warned the scheme could worsen local flooding and said unmet need for Traveller sites should not override environmental risks.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-need-and-impact">Balancing need and impact</h2>
<p>Planning officers acknowledged the objections but stressed Monmouthshire has a legal duty to provide Traveller accommodation. Its most recent <strong>Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment</strong>, approved by Welsh Government in 2024, identified a need for 13 additional pitches in the county.</p>
<p>They concluded the Llancayo site would help meet this need, and that revised drainage, flood access, and ecological measures meant the scheme now complied with planning policy.</p>
<h2 id="the-decision">The decision</h2>
<p>The planning committee first voted in July 2024 to approve the application, subject to confirmation from Natural Resources Wales that the site would not harm the River Usk SAC. That confirmation arrived in summer 2025, allowing the council to formally grant permission.</p>
<p>The approval comes with conditions requiring the drainage system to be installed and maintained as designed, ecological features (such as bird and bat boxes) to be provided, and an emergency flood access to be constructed.</p>
<p>While campaigners against the scheme remain disappointed, the family now has security of tenure on the land they have occupied for nine years.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Monmouth Town Council Planning Committee met on Tuesday, 12th August 2025, at 6.30 pm in the Roberts Room at Bridges. The meeting covered several planning applications, updates on enforcement matters, and ongoing projects affecting the town. Apologies were accepted from Councillors Rugen-Hankey and Wilcock, and Cllr Brehany sent her apologies during the meeting due to connectivity issues. No declarations of interest were made by Committee members.</p>
<p>The minutes from the previous meeting held on 22nd July 2025 were confirmed and signed as a true record. No members of the public requested to speak during the meeting. There were no late payments for approval. The Committee discussed four planning applications in detail.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500728-at-3-4-drybridge-terrace">DM/2025/00728 at 3-4 Drybridge Terrace</h2>
<p>The first application, DM/2025/00728 at 3-4 Drybridge Terrace, proposed a small single-storey rear extension. Concerns about the impact on the historic property had been raised by the Georgian Group and echoed by the Committee. However, the Committee felt that there was not enough information to fully assess the potential effects on the heritage of the building. As a result, they were unable to make a recommendation and requested that the applicant provide additional information for reconsultation.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500943-at-43-wonastow-road">DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow Road</h2>
<p>The second application, DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow Road, involved the demolition of two rear single-storey extensions and the construction of a new single-storey and two-storey rear extension, with internal alterations. The Committee considered the conditions recommended by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the Ecological Report appropriate. They recommended approval on the condition that the applicant follows NRW recommendations, obtains a bat mitigation licence, and considers adding bird boxes, particularly for Swifts, to support local biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500868-at-the-ancre-hill-rockfield-road">DM/2025/00868 at The Ancre Hill, Rockfield Road</h2>
<p>The third application, DM/2025/00868 at The Ancre Hill, Rockfield Road, proposed converting existing outbuildings into a single dwelling. The Committee noted the bat survey recommendations and found the design suitable for the location. They recommended approval, provided the applicant adheres to the conditions in the bat survey. The fourth application, DM/2025/01022 at 40 Monnow Keep, proposed converting a garage door into a solid wall with a window to create additional living accommodation. While the potential impact on parking was considered, it was not relevant for this existing property. The Committee recommended approval of the application.</p>
<p>The Committee also received an update from the Derelict Buildings Working Group. The Buildings At Risk Officer for Monmouthshire County Council, appointed on 29th July 2025, will liaise with Cllr Brehany regarding ongoing concerns. During the review of the Action Summary, the Committee noted the recent demolition of some buildings at Troy Station, discussed the proposed design of the former Gate House pub, and considered a public concern regarding paving slab colours at St Thomas Garden, where the original Monmouth stone is no longer available. It was noted that the Peacocks building has been purchased. Businesses and the Chamber of Commerce will meet with County Councillor Paul Griffiths regarding scaffolding at 10 Church Street. The Barton has now reopened and has been removed from the Action Summary.</p>
<p>The Chairperson did not provide a report at this meeting. For future discussions, the Committee agreed to include consultation on the Wonastow Road footpath closure on the next agenda and to add information about Swifts to the Town Council’s website to support local biodiversity awareness. The next Planning Committee meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 2nd September 2025.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed an appeal concerning 1 Pen Y Wern Cottage, Pen Y Wern Road, Penperlleni, Goytre (NP4 0AB). The decision was issued by Zoe Baxter BSc, MSc, MRTPI, acting as an Inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers.</p>
<p>The appeal followed the refusal of planning permission by Monmouthshire County Council in December 2024.</p>
<h2 id="appeal-details">Appeal details</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-03994-W7R9B0<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Mr Lyndon Hawkins<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of appeal:</strong> Planning permission under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Conversion of outbuilding to two holiday lettings<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/00398 (dated 25 March 2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council decision:</strong> Refused 18 December 2024<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site visit:</strong> 1 May 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Appeal was <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="main-issues">Main issues</h2>
<p>The Inspector identified two main issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether the proposed development would comply with planning policies concerning residential conversions in the countryside.<br />
</li>
<li>Whether the proposed development would adversely affect the integrity of the River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>
<h3 id="site-context">Site context</h3>
<p>The appeal site comprises an existing outbuilding within the garden of the semi-detached cottage, adjacent to the southwestern boundary and Pen Y Wern Road. Although close to Penperlleni, the property is <strong>outside the settlement boundary</strong> defined in the Monmouthshire LDP and is therefore considered to be in the countryside. During the site visit, the outbuilding was in use for storage and as a workshop.</p>
<h3 id="residential-conversion-policies">Residential conversion policies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy T2:</strong> Outside town and village boundaries, permanent serviced or self-catering visitor accommodation is permitted only if it involves <strong>re-use and adaptation of existing buildings</strong>, in compliance with Policy H4 criteria.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Policy H4:</strong> Conversion of rural buildings for residential use requires, among other things, that buildings have been used for their intended purpose for a significant period, with special scrutiny for buildings <strong>less than 10 years old</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The appellant submitted evidence that an outbuilding had existed at the site for over 70 years, including historical maps (1971) and Google Streetview images (2009, 2011).</p>
<p>However, planning permission granted in <strong>2020 (DM/2020/01459)</strong> authorized the rebuilding of the outbuilding. The new structure, while similar in size, <strong>differs in shape and position</strong>. Therefore, the outbuilding subject to the appeal has <strong>not been in use for its intended purpose for 10 years</strong>, failing the Policy H4 criterion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Inspector concluded the proposal <strong>does not comply</strong> with Policies H4 and T2 regarding residential conversions in the countryside.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="river-usk-special-area-of-conservation">River Usk Special Area of Conservation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The River Usk is a SAC protected under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.<br />
</li>
<li>Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has introduced new phosphate standards for the Wye and Usk catchments.<br />
</li>
<li>The appeal site is not on mains drainage; a <strong>private Vortex ASP sewage treatment plant</strong> was proposed.<br />
</li>
<li>The appellant provided general information on the treatment plant but <strong>no site-specific details</strong> on its location or drainage field, and no soil/percolation testing data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inspector’s conclusion:</strong> Due to limited evidence, the proposal <strong>could have a significant effect on the River Usk SAC</strong>, posing an unacceptable risk contrary to LDP Policy EP1 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.</p>
<h3 id="other-matter">Other matter</h3>
<p>The proposal could create local jobs and provide accommodation for visitors. However, the scale of the development means <strong>these benefits do not outweigh the harm</strong> identified.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proposal <strong>fails to comply with countryside conversion policies</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>The proposal <strong>poses an unacceptable risk to the River Usk SAC</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>No overriding public benefits justify granting permission.<br />
</li>
<li>In accordance with the Well-Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, the decision supports sustainable development principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final decision:</strong> The appeal is <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="council-response">Council response</h2>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed two appeals relating to North Barn at Whitehouse Farm, Llanvair Grange Road, Llanfair Kilgeddin, Monmouthshire (NP7 9BB). The decisions were issued by JP Tudor BA (Hons), Solicitor (non-practising), acting as an Inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers.</p>
<p>The appeals followed the refusal of planning permission and listed building consent by Monmouthshire County Council in January 2025.</p>
<h2 id="appeal-details">Appeal details</h2>
<h3 id="appeal-a">Appeal A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-04103-G9V3H0<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Emma Dymond<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Appeal:</strong> Planning permission under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> New single-storey rear lean-to oak-framed extension, new opening providing access from kitchen into extension, internal alterations for open-plan living space<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/01510 (dated 6 December 2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council Decision:</strong> Refused 22 January 2025<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site Visit:</strong> 18 June 2025</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="appeal-b">Appeal B</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-04104-P3D7Y2<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Emma Dymond<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Appeal:</strong> Listed building consent under section 100 of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Same as Appeal A<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/01511 (dated 6 December 2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council Decision:</strong> Refused 22 January 2025<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site Visit:</strong> 18 June 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Both appeals were <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-matters">Preliminary matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Council did not object to most internal alterations to create an open-plan living space.<br />
</li>
<li>A Heritage Impact Statement (HIS) noted that previous conversions in the 1990s–2000s had already altered the interior, and further minor changes would not adversely affect historic character.<br />
</li>
<li>Planning permission and listed building consent had already been granted for a similar scheme (DM/2024/01508 &amp; DM/2024/01509), differing only in the size of the opening from the kitchen into the extension.<br />
</li>
<li>The main dispute concerned <strong>the size of the opening in the external wall</strong> of North Barn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-issue">Main issue</h2>
<p>The Inspector identified the primary issue as whether the proposed development <strong>preserves the special architectural and historic interest</strong> of Whitehouse Farmhouse, a Grade II listed building.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>North Barn: former agricultural threshing barn, part of a group including South Barn and the Coach House.<br />
</li>
<li>While not individually listed, North Barn is <strong>curtilage-listed</strong> and enjoys the same level of statutory protection as Whitehouse Farmhouse under s76(5) of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023.<br />
</li>
<li>Legal framework: Sections 314A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Section 96 of the 2023 Act require <strong>special regard to preserving listed buildings</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Relevant policy: Planning Policy Wales (PPW, Edition 12) and Technical Advice Note 24 (TAN 24) on the historic environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="significance-of-the-site">Significance of the site</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whitehouse Farmhouse:</strong> early 17th-century Grade II listed building with much original form and period detailing.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>North Barn:</strong> rubble stone former threshing barn, possibly 18th century, converted to residential use circa 2000. Retains significance as a substantial agricultural building and part of the farmstead associated with Whitehouse Farmhouse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assessment-of-effects">Assessment of effects</h2>
<h3 id="lean-to-extension">1. Lean-to extension:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small ancillary lean-to structures are sometimes found on similar agricultural buildings.<br />
</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed two appeals relating to North Barn at Whitehouse Farm, Llanvair Grange Road, Llanfair Kilgeddin, Monmouthshire (NP7 9BB). The decisions were issued by JP Tudor BA (Hons), Solicitor (non-practising), acting as an Inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers.</p>
<p>The appeals followed the refusal of planning permission and listed building consent by Monmouthshire County Council in January 2025.</p>
<h2 id="appeal-details">Appeal details</h2>
<h3 id="appeal-a">Appeal A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-04103-G9V3H0<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Emma Dymond<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Appeal:</strong> Planning permission under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> New single-storey rear lean-to oak-framed extension, new opening providing access from kitchen into extension, internal alterations for open-plan living space<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/01510 (dated 6 December 2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council Decision:</strong> Refused 22 January 2025<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site Visit:</strong> 18 June 2025</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="appeal-b">Appeal B</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-04104-P3D7Y2<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Emma Dymond<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Appeal:</strong> Listed building consent under section 100 of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Same as Appeal A<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/01511 (dated 6 December 2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council Decision:</strong> Refused 22 January 2025<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site Visit:</strong> 18 June 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Both appeals were <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-matters">Preliminary matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Council did not object to most internal alterations to create an open-plan living space.<br />
</li>
<li>A Heritage Impact Statement (HIS) noted that previous conversions in the 1990s–2000s had already altered the interior, and further minor changes would not adversely affect historic character.<br />
</li>
<li>Planning permission and listed building consent had already been granted for a similar scheme (DM/2024/01508 &amp; DM/2024/01509), differing only in the size of the opening from the kitchen into the extension.<br />
</li>
<li>The main dispute concerned <strong>the size of the opening in the external wall</strong> of North Barn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-issue">Main issue</h2>
<p>The Inspector identified the primary issue as whether the proposed development <strong>preserves the special architectural and historic interest</strong> of Whitehouse Farmhouse, a Grade II listed building.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>North Barn: former agricultural threshing barn, part of a group including South Barn and the Coach House.<br />
</li>
<li>While not individually listed, North Barn is <strong>curtilage-listed</strong> and enjoys the same level of statutory protection as Whitehouse Farmhouse under s76(5) of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023.<br />
</li>
<li>Legal framework: Sections 314A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Section 96 of the 2023 Act require <strong>special regard to preserving listed buildings</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Relevant policy: Planning Policy Wales (PPW, Edition 12) and Technical Advice Note 24 (TAN 24) on the historic environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="significance-of-the-site">Significance of the site</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whitehouse Farmhouse:</strong> early 17th-century Grade II listed building with much original form and period detailing.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>North Barn:</strong> rubble stone former threshing barn, possibly 18th century, converted to residential use circa 2000. Retains significance as a substantial agricultural building and part of the farmstead associated with Whitehouse Farmhouse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assessment-of-effects">Assessment of effects</h2>
<h3 id="lean-to-extension">1. Lean-to extension:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small ancillary lean-to structures are sometimes found on similar agricultural buildings.<br />
</li>
<li>Size, scale, materials (oak finish, natural slate roof), and set-back from the main barn are largely acceptable.<br />
</li>
<li>Extension is potentially reversible and already benefits from extant consent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disputed-kitchen-opening">2. Disputed kitchen opening:</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="appellant-argument">3. Appellant argument:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removal of modern, unsympathetic window could improve overall elevation.<br />
</li>
<li>Acknowledged heritage impact but argued magnitude would be low due to prior conversions.<br />

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Full Council – Tuesday 8th July 2025, 7pm–9pm</strong></p>
<p>Coleford Town Council met on Tuesday 8th July with Councillors discussing a wide range of community matters, from staff appraisals and Active Travel projects to memorial benches and local awards.</p>
<h2 id="key-decisions-and-updates">Key Decisions and Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Staff appraisals</strong><br />
The Town Clerk confirmed that appraisals had been completed for the Assistant Clerk and Administrator. Both will receive a one-point salary increase in line with contracts. A review process will be looked into for Admin Officer K Hughes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flag flying requests</strong><br />
Councillors agreed that in future the Union Flag should fly on the Clock Tower throughout Armed Forces Week, while the Pride flag will be flown either side of this week and for the whole of June at Bells Field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active travel project</strong><br />
Progress was reported on the cycle and walking path. To manage costs, the scheme will now be split into three phases, with work linked to funding from the Rural England Prosperity Fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>CTC will fund the project, but long-term maintenance will remain with the landowner (FoDDC).<br />
</li>
<li>The Co-op section will be held back for possible action later due to high legal fees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rural England Prosperity Fund (REPF) applications</strong><br />
Councillors discussed three potential projects, including a “pocket park” with an industrial-meets-nature theme linked to the Railway Museum. Local schools and artists may be involved in shaping the design. The Council team has delegated authority to develop the application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cemetery projects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised about water damage affecting the Cemetery plinth mural. Councillors agreed to rethink the project and possibly halt it if necessary.<br />
</li>
<li>A request for a memorial bench in the Garden of Remembrance was approved, with the condition that it could be moved in future if the area is extended.<br />
</li>
<li>A new noticeboard will be installed at the Cemetery, with an oak frame and green background, subject to checking existing storage.<br />
</li>
<li>Councillors reaffirmed the policy that memorial benches are only allowed in the Cemetery, not in the town centre.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other local matters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bench request in Sylvan Close was approved, with fencing to be installed by TEK Fencing including anti-vandal wire.<br />
</li>
<li>Phone boxes: one in Coalway may be relocated within the parish, while the Sunnybank box will be sold to Greenacres for £250, with removal and land restoration to be completed within six months.<br />
</li>
<li>The King George V pavilion’s electrical safety certificate (EICR) has been completed and urgent items addressed. The clock will also be repaired.<br />
</li>
<li>A proposal for an Angus Buchanan bust was declined due to cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Speed limit review</strong><br />
Councillors will consider supporting 20mph zones where evidence or statistics show a clear need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community &amp; awards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The GGP Community Builder scheme was deemed district-wide and not a priority for CTC at present.<br />
</li>
<li>The Council decided not to fund sponsorship of the <em>Forest Review</em> Local Heroes Mayor’s Award, as it duplicates Coleford’s own community awards. However, they will nominate Erin Burke as “Sporting Hero” and Cllr Nick Penny will attend.<br />
</li>
<li>Cllr M Getgood was nominated to speak at a forthcoming Climate Adaptation Workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Citizen visioning</strong><br />
Six councillors attended the final presentation. While feedback was mixed on the process, the passion of participants was noted. A formal report is expected by the end of July.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Police update</strong><br />
Police statistics were noted. Concerns were raised about drug use and dealing in the town. Coleford has been added to the national “Summer Blitz” scheme.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Document Retention Policy will now keep safeguarding records for 30 years, in line with insurance requirements.<br />
</li>
<li>The Council adopted a new Expenses Policy, including mileage incentives for car-sharing.</li>
</ul></li>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Raglan, 25 June 2025</strong> – Raglan Community Council held its ordinary meeting at the Fellowship Centre on Wednesday evening, welcoming new councillor Luke Thompson and discussing a range of local issues from road safety to dog waste bins.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-a-new-councillor">Welcome to a new councillor</h2>
<p>Luke Thompson officially joined the council, signing his declaration of office. Chair Cllr Nick Ramsay welcomed him to the team, promising a smooth start as he settles into his new role.</p>
<h2 id="residents-speak-up">Residents speak up</h2>
<p>A local resident raised concerns about the Chepstow Road to Llandenny junction. The council confirmed it has already contacted Monmouthshire Highways, and the Clerk will follow up to find out when the planned safety improvements are expected.</p>
<h2 id="planning-concerns-continue">Planning concerns continue</h2>
<p>Council members discussed ongoing frustrations with planning officers who have not responded to previous correspondence. The council has now decided to make a formal complaint about the lack of communication.</p>
<p>A separate planning issue on land adjacent to High Street, Raglan, also caught the council’s attention. The proposed development of three houses was flagged as a potential traffic risk on the A40 trunk road. The council will formally object and request a decision timeline from the planning department.</p>
<h2 id="dog-walk-and-allotment-updates">Dog walk and allotment updates</h2>
<p>The popular Dog Walk area needs urgent attention. Overgrown grass, damaged footpaths, and dead trees are affecting the site. The council will take matters into its own hands, arranging maintenance, clearing debris, and upgrading footpaths.</p>
<p>Allotments also remain a priority. Some plots have been neglected, and the council will remind tenants of their responsibilities and consider reallocating plots where necessary.</p>
<h2 id="waste-and-cleanliness">Waste and cleanliness</h2>
<p>Dog waste bins purchased by the council will soon be installed by Monmouthshire County Council, following communication with both the contractor and council officers.</p>
<h2 id="community-support-and-events">Community support and events</h2>
<p>The council approved several grants, including contributions to the Raglan Festival, St Cadoc Church, and the Baptist Church. Members also discussed the Community Award Scheme and plan to meet with the Baptist Church and Minister to set clear guidelines for future awards.</p>
<h2 id="village-life-updates">Village life updates</h2>
<p>Cllr Penny Jones raised two important village matters: bus timetable accessibility and Christmas decorations. Residents have reported that digital bus timetables are difficult to read, so paper copies will also be installed. Plans for festive lighting are also underway, with council representatives following up with county officers to ensure decorations return in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="other-business">Other business</h2>
<p>The council approved the internal audit for the year ending March 2025 and agreed to submit it to Audit Wales. Several planning applications were reviewed, with most receiving no objections, while one application has been withdrawn and will be resubmitted.</p>
<p>The meeting closed at 8:14 pm, with the next session scheduled for 23 July 2025.</p>]]></description>
