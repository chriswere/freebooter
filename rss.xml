<title>Lydney Council mows down opposition in unanimous decision to purchase mighty Kubota F391</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>It was the kind of council debate that could make or break the lawns
of Lydney for generations to come: should the town invest in a brand-new
grass mower? After much deliberation (and, one assumes, a few wistful
glances out at Bathurst Park’s expansive greenery), councillors voted
unanimously to approve a five-year hire purchase agreement for the
Kubota F391 Outfront Mower — a machine so powerful it could probably
shave a cricket pitch into a snooker table if asked politely.</p>

<p>Head Gardener James, the unsung hero of the town’s grassy horizons,
presented his case for the 37-horsepower diesel beast. No longer would
the council’s green team have to wrestle with outdated kit; now, they
would be armed with hydrostatic all-wheel-drive, LED headlights, and —
perhaps most importantly — a 72-inch cutting deck capable of chewing
through unruly tufts faster than you can say “mulching efficiency.”</p>
<p>The Kubota F391, described in the manufacturer’s blurb as “the
efficiency machine,” promises not only to keep Lydney’s parks trim and
proper but also to deliver an “excellent power-to-cost ratio.” In plain
English: it’s expensive, yes, but it cuts grass very, very well.</p>
<p>Councillors were suitably impressed. “This mower doesn’t just cut
grass, it defines a town,” one might imagine a councillor saying as
visions of perfectly striped verges danced before their eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, in the age of accountability, the mower’s movements will
not go unmonitored. Alongside the purchase, the council requested
costings on fitting GPS trackers to all council vehicles, including this
new leviathan of lawn care. After all, nobody wants to wake up one
morning to find the pride of Lydney Council joyriding through
Coleford.</p>
<p>While the finer points of mulching quality, ergonomic operator
platforms, and puncture-proof support wheels may not capture the
imagination of every resident, there is little doubt that the decision
will have visible consequences. From Bathurst Park to the Mesne,
Lydney’s green spaces look set to be manicured with precision that would
make even Wimbledon’s groundskeepers blush.</p>
<p>The verdict is in: the Kubota F391 is coming to town. And while it
may not solve traffic problems, planning disputes, or the eternal saga
of community asset listings, at least the grass will look immaculate
while those debates rage on.</p>]]></description>

<title>Forest MP hits out at court backlogs and calls for reform</title>
<link>https://freebooter.uk/posts/forest-mp-hits-out-at-court-backlogs-and-calls-for-reform/</link>
<guid>https://freebooter.uk/posts/forest-mp-hits-out-at-court-backlogs-and-calls-for-reform/</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 19:46:22 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has warned that tackling the growing
Crown Court backlog requires more than simply adding sitting days—it
needs fundamental reform, during a commons debate (3 July).</p>
<p>“With the Crown Court backlog that we inherited at such high levels,
and continuing to rise, does the Minister agree that tackling it means
not just adding more sitting days but making fundamental reform?” Bishop
asked.</p>
<p>The Minister of State for Justice, Sarah Sackman, agreed the
situation is intolerable. She described record backlogs in the criminal
courts as having a serious human impact on victims, witnesses, and court
staff, and said radical structural reform is needed alongside increased
sitting days. Sackman cited the forthcoming work of Sir Brian Leveson
and the Ministry’s £450 million investment in courts as part of efforts
to restore confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Other MPs also spoke during the debate. Conservative Ashley Fox
warned that increasing early guilty plea discounts to 40% could
undermine trust in the system, and questioned proposals for an
“intermediate court” aimed at speeding up cases. Sackman said the
courts’ priority is delivering swift justice, not cost-saving.</p>
<p>Emily Thornberry, drawing on 20 years’ experience as a barrister,
said delays in Crown courts have led some defendants to plead “not
guilty” knowing their case would take years to reach trial. Sackman
responded that reform will consider new technologies and efficiencies
while maintaining the integrity of jury trials.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds shared his personal experience as a
juror, highlighting that jurors are often underused. Sackman said the
issue is overall system capacity—judges, lawyers, courtrooms, and
resources—not the jury system itself.</p>
<p>Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell and Uma Kumaran, stressed the
importance of restoring public confidence, particularly for victims of
crime. Kumaran highlighted that under the previous Conservative
government, 60% of rape victims withdrew their cases due to delays.
Sackman emphasised that victims must see timely justice, and investment
in victims’ services is a key part of reforms.</p>
<p>Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts warned that removing jury rights
for sentences under two years in an intermediate court would not address
years of underfunding and staff shortages in magistrates courts. Sackman
said the government aims for whole-system reform, respecting the local
role of magistrates courts while tackling the backlog across the
criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Other MPs, including Christopher Vince, noted the effects of previous
court closures on victims’ confidence, echoing calls for fundamental
reform. Sackman reiterated that the government is committed to restoring
the system, ensuring that victims receive timely justice, and addressing
the backlog comprehensively.</p>]]></description>

<title>Forest of Dean Freeminers’ rights protected in Government coal plans</title>
<link>https://freebooter.uk/posts/forest-of-dean-freeminers’-rights-protected-in-government-coal-plans/</link>
<guid>https://freebooter.uk/posts/forest-of-dean-freeminers’-rights-protected-in-government-coal-plans/</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 16:29:02 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has pressed the government on its plans
to restrict new coal mining licences, asking how his department will
protect the unique rights of local Freeminers (7 July 2025).</p>
<p>Mister Bishop asked the Secretary of State for Energy Security and
Net Zero what progress had been made on legislative proposals to amend
the Coal Industry Act 1994, ensuring that new coal extraction licences
would be prohibited, while safeguarding Freeminers’ centuries-old
rights.</p>
<p>Michael Shanks, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the
Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed that the
government intends to introduce the legislation “as soon as possible.”
He reassured that the historic rights of Freeminers in the Forest of
Dean will be fully exempted, allowing them to continue mining under
their traditional rules.</p>
<p>Freemining is a rare and historic custom, dating back to 1244. To
become a Freeminer, an individual must be born and bred within the
“Hundred of St Briavels,” be at least 21 years old, and have worked a
year and a day in a mine. Registered Freeminers are entitled to mine
personal plots, known as gales. Since the 1840s, more than 4,300
Freeminers have been registered, and in 2010 women were included for the
first time.</p>
<p>Mining has shaped the Forest of Dean for centuries and continues to
influence local life. Notably, the Forest of Dean Cycle Centre is built
on a former colliery site, with the old mine’s terrain providing ideal
conditions for downhill trails.</p>
<p>Bishop said he welcomed the government’s commitment, highlighting the
importance of protecting the Forest’s historic mining traditions while
moving forward with modern energy policy.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouth MP makes case for Magor and Undy station in Commons debate</title>

<pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 15:19:02 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes made a strong case in the House of
Commons (8 July 2025) for a new station at Magor and Undy, highlighting
its potential to transform local transport and open up jobs for
residents without cars. Speaking during a debate on road and rail
projects, Fookes welcomed the Government’s “ramped up” spending and the
£445 million earmarked for Wales in the recent spending review.</p>
<p>Fookes argued that the Magor and Undy station could reduce congestion
on the M4 while giving people without cars better access to employment
opportunities. She suggested that the site could be an ideal candidate
for one of the first five “Burns stations,” thanks to existing track and
infrastructure already in place.</p>
<p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander praised Fookes for her advocacy,
describing her as “a fearsome champion” for the station. Alexander
confirmed the £445 million would be spread over the next ten years to
correct historic underinvestment in Welsh rail and said the Wales Rail
Board would set priorities to ensure communities like Fookes’ benefit
from the funding.</p>
<p>The debate also saw Plaid Cymru MP Ann Davies raise concerns that the
£445 million would cover just five stations, leaving areas west of
Cardiff, such as St Clears, without support despite long-standing
promises. Alexander defended the funding, describing it as a “step
change” for Welsh rail, covering both development projects and new
infrastructure across south and north Wales, and offered to discuss
specific local schemes further.</p>
<p>Fookes’ intervention highlighted the importance of investing in local
transport links to both tackle congestion and improve access to jobs.
Her call for Magor and Undy to become an early Burns station signals a
potential turning point for the region’s transport network, promising
tangible benefits for residents and local commuters alike.</p>]]></description>

<title>UK justice system faces urgent reforms amid backlogs and calls to protect jury trials</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The House of Commons heard extensive debate (9 July) on the state of
the UK criminal justice system, as MPs pressed the Government on
backlogs, court delays, and the future of jury trials. The discussion
followed the release of Sir Brian Leveson’s report, which called for
once-in-a-generation reforms to improve efficiency and ensure timely
justice.</p>
<p>Labour MPs highlighted the human cost of the backlog, noting that
under the previous Conservative Government, 60% of rape victims
abandoned their cases due to lengthy delays. Minister of State for
Justice Sarah Sackman acknowledged the scale of the problem, emphasizing
investment in victims’ services, the strengthening of the Victims’ Code,
and the critical need for timely trials.</p>
<p>Local justice concerns were raised by Plaid Cymru’s Liz
Saville-Roberts, who pointed to underfunding, court closures, and staff
shortages affecting magistrates courts. Sackman confirmed the Government
would pursue whole-system reforms rather than piecemeal changes, while
noting that investments had already been made to maintain and improve
court infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sackman defended the Government’s record on prison investment, noting
that 14,000 new prison places had been committed alongside sentencing
reforms and £450 million allocated to courts. She stressed that
additional Crown Court sitting days—over 4,000 more than previously
agreed—were part of the effort to tackle delays, but structural reform
remained essential.</p>
<p>The debate also focused on the role of jury trials. Concerns were
raised about any potential erosion of the right to a jury, with MPs
warning that such changes could undermine public confidence. Sackman
repeatedly reassured the House that jury trials would remain central for
serious cases, while noting that Sir Brian Leveson’s recommendations
emphasized proportionate reforms to ensure timely justice. She argued
that the current system’s delays, not trial format, posed the greatest
threat to both victims and defendants.</p>
<p>Questions were also raised about plea bargaining, with opposition MPs
urging the Government to rule out reducing sentences by up to 40% for
guilty pleas—a practice common in the United States. Sackman confirmed
the Government had no intention of replicating the US system and
emphasized careful policy development to balance swifter justice with
public protection.</p>
<p>Some MPs suggested adopting practices from other jurisdictions,
including intensive supervision courts and faster hearings for domestic
abuse cases. Sackman said the Government would consider lessons from
abroad, alongside preventive interventions and rehabilitation programs,
to reduce reoffending and relieve court backlogs.</p>
<p>The debate underscored a shared recognition across parties that the
UK criminal justice system is at a critical juncture. Sackman stressed
that reform, investment, and engagement with legal professionals would
be central to addressing backlogs, protecting victims, and maintaining
public confidence in both jury trials and the wider judicial
process.</p>]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House of Commons heard extensive debate (9 July) on the state of
the UK criminal justice system, as MPs pressed the Government on
backlogs, court delays, and the future of jury trials. The discussion
followed the release of Sir Brian Leveson’s report, which called for
once-in-a-generation reforms to improve efficiency and ensure timely
justice.</p>
<p>Labour MPs highlighted the human cost of the backlog, noting that
under the previous Conservative Government, 60% of rape victims
abandoned their cases due to lengthy delays. Minister of State for
Justice Sarah Sackman acknowledged the scale of the problem, emphasizing
investment in victims’ services, the strengthening of the Victims’ Code,
and the critical need for timely trials.</p>
<p>Local justice concerns were raised by Plaid Cymru’s Liz
Saville-Roberts, who pointed to underfunding, court closures, and staff
shortages affecting magistrates courts. Sackman confirmed the Government
would pursue whole-system reforms rather than piecemeal changes, while
noting that investments had already been made to maintain and improve
court infrastructure.</p>

<title>Monmouth MP Catherine Fookes defends Labour's autumn budget</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouth MP <strong>Catherine Fookes</strong> has defended Labour’s
autumn budget, and how it impacts Welsh farmers.</p>
<p>Speaking on <strong>16 July 2025</strong>, Fookes pointed out that
the <strong>Welsh Government’s budget contains over £300
million</strong> to support farmers and accused Plaid Cymru and the
Tories were putting farmers’ livelihoods at risk by voting against the
funding.</p>
<p>The debate focused on the potential impact of the <strong>autumn
budget 2024</strong> on Welsh family farms. The Minister for Wales,
<strong>Nia Griffith</strong>, confirmed that the Government had
<strong>protected the farm budget</strong> and allocated <strong>£337
million</strong> to the Welsh Government. Griffith also highlighted a
new <strong>UK-EU agrifood deal</strong>, which will remove routine
border checks on British goods such as dairy, fish, eggs, and red meat,
reducing costs and paperwork for farmers.</p>
<p>Concerns were also raised about the <strong>Sustainable Farming
Scheme (SFS)</strong>, a government plan aimed at promoting
environmentally friendly farming. While the scheme has a
<strong>transition period</strong> and a <strong>basic payment
scheme</strong> for those not yet in the program, some farmers have
expressed worries about its complexity and potential impact on
production. Griffith noted that the scheme provides “workable payment
rates and much needed stability for the sector.”</p>
<p>The <strong>National Farmers’ Union (NFU)</strong> has warned that
planned changes to the <strong>family farm inheritance tax</strong>
could disproportionately affect working farms, according to a new report
by the <strong>Centre for the Analysis of Taxation
(CenTax)</strong>.</p>
<p>The report, titled <em>“The impact of changes to inheritance tax on
farm estates”</em>, uses <strong>HMRC data from 2018-2022</strong> to
examine the government’s proposed reforms to <strong>Agricultural
Property Relief (APR)</strong> and <strong>Business Property Relief
(BPR)</strong>. It found that <strong>around 480 farm estates a
year</strong> would pay additional tax, with <strong>50% of
owner-farmers, tenant farmers, and mixed tenure farmers</strong>
impacted. Non-farming landowners would be less affected, with only 20%
facing higher tax.</p>
<p>NFU President <strong>Tom Bradshaw</strong> said the proposals “do
little to counter those who seek to shelter wealth from inheritance tax
by investing in farmland” and called for <strong>fairer
targeting</strong> to protect working farms. He welcomed CenTax’s
analysis as a chance for “fresh conversations” with the government ahead
of the Finance Bill.</p>
<p>The report also highlighted <strong>affordability issues</strong>.
Most impacted farm estates could pay through non-farm assets, but
<strong>70 estates per year</strong> could not, and would need to use
future profits over 10 years. Impacted estates were generally held by
older owners, with over <strong>80% aged 75 and above</strong>.</p>
<p>CenTax proposed several <strong>alternatives</strong> to better
support working farms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum share rule</strong>: APR and BPR qualifying assets
must make up at least 60% of net worth to qualify for higher relief,
aiming to separate working farmers from investors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Upper limit on relief</strong>: 100% relief on the first £2m
of assets, then 50% up to £10m, with no relief above that.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Combination of both</strong>: Higher allowances for working
farms while limiting relief for larger estates.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to CenTax, these alternatives could <strong>raise more tax
revenue</strong> than the government’s current proposal while
<strong>better protecting working farmers</strong>.</p>
<p>The NFU is urging the government to use this analysis to ensure
<strong>fairness and affordability</strong> in the upcoming reforms.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council is asking residents to share their views
on how the county manages flood risk. A public consultation is now open
on the council’s draft <strong>Local Flood Risk Management
Strategy</strong>, which sets out plans for the next six years.</p>
<p>The consultation runs from <strong>Friday 1 August until Friday 26
September, 2025</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-consultation-about">What’s the consultation
about?</h2>
<p>The draft strategy explains how the council plans to deal with
flooding from surface water, groundwater and smaller local rivers and
streams. It builds on the county’s first flood strategy from 2013 and
takes into account lessons from recent major floods, new legislation and
national policy changes.</p>
<p>Residents are being asked to give feedback on the proposals, either
online or by filling in a paper survey available from their nearest
Community Hub. The council says local experiences are vital to shaping
its plans.</p>
<h2 id="drop-in-events">Drop-in events</h2>
<p>People can also speak to officers in person at drop-in sessions

<title>New walking routes connect the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean to Britain’s national network</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A growing national project is opening up new opportunities for
walkers in the <strong>Wye Valley and Forest of Dean</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://slowways.org">Slow Ways</a>, a non-profit
initiative, is building a walking network that connects every town,
city, and national landscape in Britain. The idea is, if people know
there’s a safe and clear way to walk somewhere, they’re more likely to
do it.</p>
<p>Started in 2020 by geographer <strong>Dan Raven-Ellison</strong>,
Slow Ways has grown with the help of thousands of volunteers. Together
they have created nearly <strong>10,000 routes</strong> linking over
<strong>2,500 places</strong>. Many of these walks pass through or
connect to our area – from the <strong>market towns of the Forest of
Dean</strong> to the villages and riverside paths of the <strong>Wye
Valley</strong>.</p>
<p>The Slow Ways routes are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be safe, direct, and accessible</li>
<li>Avoid busy roads where possible</li>
<li>Include resting places every 5–10 km</li>
<li>Pass through public transport hubs</li>
<li>Be enjoyable and easy to follow</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every path is suitable for everyone, but routes are tested by
walkers and wheelchair/scooter users. Reviews, star ratings, and surveys
help highlight surface quality, gradients, and obstacles like stiles or
mud. Routes with three or more positive reviews become “verified” –
tried and tested by the community.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is about more than just hiking. It encourages people to
walk or wheel for everyday journeys, like visiting friends, shopping, or
commuting, as well as for longer adventures.</p>
<p>You can explore the routes through the <strong>Slow Ways
website</strong>, their iOS and Android apps, or printed maps and
atlases. Each walk comes with practical advice and friendly tips from
other walkers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is powered by citizens, not governments – although the team
hopes local and national authorities will support and invest in the
future of walking.</p>
<p>Their long-term vision is for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong> – safe and inclusive routes for all
abilities</li>
<li><strong>Everywhere</strong> – a walking network as simple to use as
the road system</li>
<li><strong>Every day</strong> – walking and wheeling as natural parts
of daily life</li>
<li><strong>Every time</strong> – reliable paths, with data to give
confidence before setting out</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to explore or contribute to this growing network, visit
<a href="https://slowways.org">slowways.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can also share your own experiences, review routes, and help
verify paths in the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean. Every contribution
makes a difference – strengthening a network that connects people to
nature, to each other, and to the wider world.</p>
<p>For help, you can contact the Slow Ways team at
<strong>hello@slowways.org</strong> or find them on social media,
including Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, X, and LinkedIn. Issues can be
reported to <strong>support@slowways.zendesk.com</strong>.</p>

<title>Monmouth Raft Race faces uncertain future as River Wye runs low</title>
<link>https://freebooter.uk/posts/monmouth-raft-race-faces-uncertain-future-as-river-wye-runs-low/</link>
<guid>https://freebooter.uk/posts/monmouth-raft-race-faces-uncertain-future-as-river-wye-runs-low/</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:29:53 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The 58th Monmouth Raft Race could be in jeopardy this year as the
drought-hit River Wye continues to struggle with extremely low water
levels. Organisers are monitoring the situation closely and plan to make
a final decision on Sunday 31 August.</p>
<p>Norman Williams, who has run the raft race for the past 22 years,
said: “At the moment it’s difficult to say what is happening. We will
watch the weather and have a meeting this Sunday, August 31. At present
we have 45 entrants all hoping to raise money for good causes. We
sincerely hope that the event can go ahead. Perhaps praying for rain is
our last hope?”</p>
<p>The low water levels pose several challenges. Around 400 yards of the
course may only be navigable by dragging or carrying rafts over the
stony riverbed, creating safety risks, especially for heavier rafts.
Crews are being advised to keep rafts as light as possible and ensure
they have the physical capability to handle these tricky sections.</p>
<p>The river is also flowing slowly, meaning participants will need
extra effort to complete the six-mile course. Beyond the practical
concerns, there are environmental worries. The Wye is a vital habitat
currently under stress, with high river temperatures threatening fish
populations, according to Natural Resources Wales. Holding the race
could disturb the wildlife and damage the riverbed in these fragile
conditions.</p>
<p>If the race is cancelled, entry fees will be refunded, though
organisers are encouraging participants to consider donating their fees
to St David’s Hospice Care, a Gwent-based charity providing free,
at-home care to patients with life-threatening illnesses. The same
option is available to those who withdraw voluntarily.</p>
<p>The race is scheduled to start at noon on Sunday 7 September from
Monmouth Rowing Club, following a 6.5-mile route down the Wye to Tump
Farm, Whitebrook, where a family festival with entertainment and
refreshments awaits. Participants are encouraged to seek sponsorship
from employers or local pubs, combining team-building fun with support
for a worthy cause.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouthshire set for biggest-ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning</title>

<pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:19:04 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire schools and community groups are being invited to take
part in the county’s largest-ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning during this
year’s Fairtrade Fortnight, running from 22 September to 5 October.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to raise awareness not just of the social impact
of Fairtrade, but also its environmental benefits. Coffee production can
contribute to tropical deforestation, but Fairtrade-certified coffee
guarantees that farmers are paid a fair price while ensuring that native
forests remain protected.</p>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council and local Fairtrade Town groups are
encouraging schools and community groups to host their own coffee
morning at a time that suits them during the Fortnight. Participating
schools will receive Fairtrade coffee for their staff rooms and can take
part in a free online, interactive lesson from the charity Size of
Wales, which explores the link between coffee and tropical
rainforests.</p>
<p>Some lucky schools will also have the chance to win extra treats,
including a Fairtrade chocolate brownie-making workshop or a visit from
a Ugandan coffee farmer, who will share how Fairtrade has positively
impacted her community.</p>
<p>Councillor Catrin Maby, Cabinet Member for Climate and Environment,
said: “More and more people know now about the difference that buying
Fairtrade makes to the lives of growers and producers, but not so many
people are aware of the environmental benefits that Fairtrade brings.
That’s why we want lots of schools and groups to get involved in the
biggest ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning to help get the message out
there!”</p>
<p>Schools and community groups can register to take part by contacting
hazelclatworthy@monmouthshire.gov.uk.</p>]]></description>

<title>Tree felling and historic renovations given green light by council</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide range of planning
applications in recent weeks, covering tree maintenance, removals,
property renovations, and historic building repairs. The decisions
highlight the council’s ongoing efforts to balance safety, preservation,
and modern living needs across the county.</p>
<h2 id="tree-works">Tree works</h2>
<p>In Abergavenny, five trees at 15 Wedgwood Gardens will undergo
maintenance. Two ash trees suffering from ash dieback will be reduced to
monoliths to encourage regeneration, while two further ash trees leaning
over Hillside Road will have overhanging branches removed and crowns
thinned to improve safety. A sweet chestnut will also have branches
overhanging the road removed.</p>
<p>In Caldicot, approval was granted for the removal of a single conifer
at 45 Church Road. Meanwhile, at 34 Woodside, Llanbadoc, a leylandi and
a conifer on the driveway side of the property will be removed.</p>
<p>At Silver How, Llanhennock, multiple trees will undergo works
including crown reductions, removal of deadwood, and felling of dead or
diseased trees such as ash, elm, and beech. Several oak trees will have
crown lifting and removal of excessive growth to ensure safety and
improve long-term health.</p>
<p>In Chepstow, two mature walnut trees at Crossways Farm will have
crowns thinned by up to 20% and lower limbs removed where they overhang
the pavement and driveway.</p>
<p>Other approved tree works include shaping and reduction of cherry and
hawthorn trees at Applecross Cottage, Mathern, felling of a Magnolia at
Masonic Hall, Monmouth, and a 30% crown reduction of a Sycamore at 9
Company Farm Drive, Llanfoist.</p>
<p>At Bushes Farm, Chapel Road, Earlswood, Shirenewton, the council
approved the discharge of Condition 8 linked to a previous planning
decision, allowing tree-related works on the site to proceed in line
with approved plans.</p>
<h2 id="property-renovations-and-historic-building-works">Property
renovations and historic building works</h2>
<p>At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the
discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent.
The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the timber cupola, a
small decorative structure on top of the main roof that provides
ventilation and adds architectural character to the historic house. The
restoration will preserve this key architectural feature while ensuring
it remains safe and functional.</p>
<p>In Grosmont, modifications to a previous approval at Broome Villa,
Hand Road were approved. The works involve extending, improving, and
remodelling the detached house and outbuildings, alongside creating a
new vehicular access and parking area, modernising the property while
maintaining harmony with the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>At Merrig Mill, Tregagle, Trellech, a series of renovations and
small-scale construction projects were approved. These include
converting a single-storey stone outbuilding, formerly used as a stable,
into a bedroom and shower room, constructing a new small stable attached
to the ancillary barn, and renovating an existing barn within the
domestic curtilage for personal residential use.</p>
<p>All applications were validated and decided between 26 and 27 August
2025.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Forest of Dean District Council has unveiled an ambitious new
vision for <strong>Five Acres</strong> in Berry Hill, creating a hub of
leisure, education, and community activities for residents across the
district. The project is designed to bring people together, provide
modern facilities, and support the health and wellbeing of the local
community.</p>
<h2 id="phase-one-indoor-facilities-and-community-spaces">Phase one:
indoor facilities and community spaces</h2>
<p>The first phase of the redevelopment focuses on the
<strong>refurbishment of the former Speedwell Building</strong> and the
creation of new indoor leisure facilities. Plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>large 53-station gym</strong> for all ages and
abilities<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Power-assisted exercise rooms</strong> and group exercise
space<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Soft play areas</strong> and party rooms for children<br />
</li>
<li>A <strong>café</strong> for visitors<br />
</li>
<li>Repurposed upper floors of the Speedwell Building for <strong>office
and community space</strong><br />
</li>
<li>A dedicated <strong>outreach space for Hartpury University’s
Aspiration Centre</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>New car parking</strong> and a secure <strong>cycle parking
facility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The designs have been carefully developed with input from residents
and community groups, ensuring that the facilities meet local needs
while remaining <strong>financially and environmentally
sustainable</strong>. Energy-efficient features such as <strong>air
source heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, and electric vehicle
charging points</strong> are included to ensure a long-term positive
impact.</p>
<h2 id="phase-two-outdoor-sports-facilities">Phase two: outdoor sports
facilities</h2>
<p>The second phase focuses on the <strong>3G artificial pitch</strong>,
which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full-size pitch</strong> suitable for football and rugby
training and competitive games<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Floodlights and spectator area</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Compliance with <strong>World Rugby Reg22 standards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This phase is part of a successful funding bid to the
<strong>Football Association</strong> in January 2025. A
<strong>planning application (P0087/25/FUL)</strong> has been submitted
and is under consideration.</p>
<p>The pitch location has been carefully chosen due to site constraints
such as a capped mining shaft and tree root protection zones. It is
designed to meet the growing demand for 3G pitches in the district,
which currently has a shortfall of two full-size pitches for local
teams.</p>
<h2 id="future-expansion-and-flexibility">Future expansion and
flexibility</h2>
<p>Although the initial plans do not include a swimming pool or new
tennis courts, the design leaves <strong>space for future
expansion</strong>. The Sports Hall has been reoriented, and corridors
included to allow for potential future facilities without disrupting
current operations.</p>
<p>A <strong>small performance venue</strong> will be included in the
Sports Hall, allowing for exhibitions, static displays, or live
performances. Retractable bleacher seating for up to 450 people could be
added in future phases if funding becomes available.</p>
<p>The athletics track, owned by Five Acres High School, could be
upgraded in the future with support from the council and advice from
England Athletics.</p>
<h2 id="education-and-community-partnerships">Education and community
partnerships</h2>
<p>Hartpury University and College will <strong>lease two rooms</strong>
within the refurbished Speedwell Building for its <strong>Aspiration
Centre</strong>, creating a local outreach hub. This centre will provide
programmes and activities aimed at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising aspirations among young people in the Forest of Dean<br />
</li>
<li>Promoting further and higher education opportunities<br />
</li>
<li>Supporting business and employer pathways</li>
</ul>
<p>The partnership with Hartpury also aims to <strong>reduce travel and
carbon emissions</strong> for students by bringing education closer to
home.</p>
<h2 id="funding-and-redevelopment">Funding and redevelopment</h2>
<p>The redevelopment is being funded by the council through a
<strong>successful Levelling Up Fund bid</strong>, which also
supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>flagship University, Careers &amp; Enterprise Learning
Centre</strong> and electric vehicle car park at Hartpury<br />
</li>
<li>Transformation of <strong>three prominent buildings in Cinderford
town centre</strong> to support businesses, social enterprises,
training, and the arts</li>
</ul>
<p>The council purchased the Five Acres site from <strong>Homes England
in December 2021 for £1</strong>, with the goal of creating a new
council-owned leisure and community destination. Demolition of the
previous structures has been completed, and the site is now cleared and
ready for construction.</p>
<h2 id="community-consultation">Community consultation</h2>
<p>Early consultation events were held at <strong>Berry Hill Primary
School</strong> and <strong>Five Acres High School</strong>, helping
shape the phased design approach. Further community information events
will be organised as the project progresses, keeping residents updated
on plans for both indoor and outdoor facilities.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</h2>
<p>The council’s vision for Five Acres is to create a <strong>hub for
community activity</strong> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sports and leisure facilities for all ages<br />
</li>
<li>Spaces for socialising and community groups<br />
</li>
<li>Opportunities for small businesses to start or grow<br />
</li>
<li>Potential for a hotel to support local tourism in future phases</li>
</ul>
<p>The project aligns with the <strong>Allocations Plan</strong> and the
<strong>Berry Hill, Christchurch, and Edge End Neighbourhood
Plan</strong>, ensuring it meets local planning and community
objectives.</p>
<h2 id="key-facts-about-facilities">Key facts about facilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swimming pool</strong>: No current plans due to lack of
funding. Space is reserved for future development.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Tennis courts</strong>: Currently in poor condition; future
upgrades will depend on user demand and funding. Multi-use options for
basketball or netball may be considered.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>3G pitch</strong>: Designed for full-size football and
rugby, with planned community use from 5-9pm weekdays and potential
daytime school use.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Sports Hall</strong>: Multi-purpose space for badminton,
football, or community events, with flexible line markings and potential
retractable seating.</li>

<title>Monmouth’s Vanessa Ruck maps out the ultimate one-day motorcycle ride through the Wye Valley</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouth motorcyclist and social media personality <a
href="https://thegirlonabike.com">Vanessa Ruck</a> – widely known as The
Girl on a Bike – has released her guide to what she describes as the
“ultimate one-day motorcycle trip in the UK,” starting and finishing in
the Wye Valley.</p>
<figure>

alt="Vanessa Ruck on a Tiger 900" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Vanessa Ruck on a Tiger 900</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The route showcases some of the area’s best riding roads, including
the A466 from Chepstow to Monmouth, the B4235, the A4136 towards Symonds
Yat, and a return stretch along the River Wye. The ride is designed to
highlight both the scenery and the wealth of local stop-offs that make
the valley such a draw for visitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3B7rF9i_hQ">Watch the video
of her journey</a>.</p>
<p>Among the suggested breaks are Monmouth’s historic high street and
picnic area, the Lion Inn at Trellech, and Symonds Yat Rock with its
panoramic views across the valley. Other recommended stops include
Tintern Abbey, the Old Station Tintern, and Bigsweir Bridge – one of the
most photographed crossings of the River Wye.</p>
<p>Vanessa, who has built an online following of more than 460,000
across her channels, has become known for her motorcycle adventures and
honest storytelling. After a road traffic accident in 2014 left her
facing seven surgeries and years of recovery, she turned to motorcycling
as both a form of escapism and a way to embrace new challenges. Since
then, she has ridden across the world, from Iceland to Bolivia, and now
shares her passion for exploring closer to home.</p>
<p>Her Wye Valley loop is promoted as a one-day ride, but she also
highlights how it can be extended into a weekend. Additional attractions
nearby include Clearwell Caves, Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean,
Goodrich Castle, and filming locations from the Netflix series Sex
Education.</p>
<p>Accommodation suggestions along the route range from local inns such
as the Lion in Trellech to guesthouses in Monmouth and Tintern, with
plenty of smaller bed and breakfasts tucked away in the surrounding
countryside.</p>
<p>With its combination of winding woodland roads, historic landmarks
and riverside views, the route underlines why the Wye Valley is so often
described as one of the UK’s most scenic regions – and now has the
endorsement of one of Monmouth’s most recognisable adventurers.</p>]]></description>

picnic area, the Lion Inn at Trellech, and Symonds Yat Rock with its
panoramic views across the valley. Other recommended stops include
Tintern Abbey, the Old Station Tintern, and Bigsweir Bridge – one of the
most photographed crossings of the River Wye.</p>
<p>Vanessa, who has built an online following of more than 460,000
across her channels, has become known for her motorcycle adventures and
honest storytelling. After a road traffic accident in 2014 left her
facing seven surgeries and years of recovery, she turned to motorcycling
as both a form of escapism and a way to embrace new challenges. Since
then, she has ridden across the world, from Iceland to Bolivia, and now
shares her passion for exploring closer to home.</p>
<p>Her Wye Valley loop is promoted as a one-day ride, but she also
highlights how it can be extended into a weekend. Additional attractions
nearby include Clearwell Caves, Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean,
Goodrich Castle, and filming locations from the Netflix series Sex
Education.</p>
<p>Accommodation suggestions along the route range from local inns such
as the Lion in Trellech to guesthouses in Monmouth and Tintern, with
plenty of smaller bed and breakfasts tucked away in the surrounding
countryside.</p>
<p>With its combination of winding woodland roads, historic landmarks
and riverside views, the route underlines why the Wye Valley is so often
described as one of the UK’s most scenic regions – and now has the
endorsement of one of Monmouth’s most recognisable adventurers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Bungalow approved for rear of Park Close property after controversial debate</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A controversial plan to build a bungalow in the back garden of a Park
Close home has been given the green light by Monmouthshire County
Council, following months of debate and several amendments to the
scheme.</p>
<p>The planning meeting can be view on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=oO8eAeFOOeW7ipjL&amp;t=262">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The application sought permission to construct a single-storey
property with its own parking and turning space behind 11 Park Close in
Abergavenny.</p>
<p>The scheme was first brought before councillors in January, when it
faced strong opposition over the narrow three-metre access lane, which
fell short of Welsh planning standards. A tied vote in February left the
decision hanging, but the applicant later submitted revised plans with
improved parking and manoeuvring space, as well as details on drainage
and biodiversity measures.</p>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council maintained its objection, raising issues
around drainage, biodiversity, and potential access disputes between
neighbours. Several local residents also criticised the plan, warning of
loss of green space, privacy concerns, and overdevelopment of the
area.</p>
<p>Despite these objections, county highways officers withdrew their
earlier concerns, concluding that the updated design provided safe
access and sufficient parking. Biodiversity officers accepted new
measures, including bird boxes, hedgehog-friendly fencing, and
landscaping, while flood and drainage specialists confirmed that surface
water could be managed through a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS).
Archaeologists also noted that the site sits in a sensitive area,
requiring mitigation work during construction.</p>
<p>Planning officers recommended approval, highlighting that the
bungalow’s design was modest, single-storey, and in keeping with the
area, with minimal impact on neighbouring homes. Councillors agreed,
granting permission subject to strict conditions — including removal of
permitted development rights, landscaping requirements, and a financial
contribution towards affordable housing.</p>]]></description>

<pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed an appeal concerning 1 Pen Y
Wern Cottage, Pen Y Wern Road, Penperlleni, Goytre (NP4 0AB). The
decision was issued by Zoe Baxter BSc, MSc, MRTPI, acting as an
Inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers.</p>
<p>The appeal followed the refusal of planning permission by
Monmouthshire County Council in December 2024.</p>
<h2 id="appeal-details">Appeal details</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-03994-W7R9B0<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Mr Lyndon Hawkins<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of appeal:</strong> Planning permission under section
78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Conversion of outbuilding to two holiday
lettings<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/00398 (dated 25 March
2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council decision:</strong> Refused 18 December 2024<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site visit:</strong> 1 May 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Appeal was <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="main-issues">Main issues</h2>
<p>The Inspector identified two main issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether the proposed development would comply with planning policies
concerning residential conversions in the countryside.<br />
</li>
<li>Whether the proposed development would adversely affect the
integrity of the River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>
<h3 id="site-context">Site context</h3>
<p>The appeal site comprises an existing outbuilding within the garden
of the semi-detached cottage, adjacent to the southwestern boundary and
Pen Y Wern Road. Although close to Penperlleni, the property is
<strong>outside the settlement boundary</strong> defined in the
Monmouthshire LDP and is therefore considered to be in the countryside.
During the site visit, the outbuilding was in use for storage and as a
workshop.</p>
<h3 id="residential-conversion-policies">Residential conversion
policies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy T2:</strong> Outside town and village boundaries,
permanent serviced or self-catering visitor accommodation is permitted
only if it involves <strong>re-use and adaptation of existing
buildings</strong>, in compliance with Policy H4 criteria.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Policy H4:</strong> Conversion of rural buildings for
residential use requires, among other things, that buildings have been
used for their intended purpose for a significant period, with special
scrutiny for buildings <strong>less than 10 years old</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The appellant submitted evidence that an outbuilding had existed at
the site for over 70 years, including historical maps (1971) and Google
Streetview images (2009, 2011).</p>
<p>However, planning permission granted in <strong>2020
(DM/2020/01459)</strong> authorized the rebuilding of the outbuilding.
The new structure, while similar in size, <strong>differs in shape and
position</strong>. Therefore, the outbuilding subject to the appeal has
<strong>not been in use for its intended purpose for 10 years</strong>,
failing the Policy H4 criterion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Inspector concluded the proposal <strong>does not
comply</strong> with Policies H4 and T2 regarding residential
conversions in the countryside.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="river-usk-special-area-of-conservation">River Usk Special Area
of Conservation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The River Usk is a SAC protected under the Conservation of Habitats
and Species Regulations 2017.<br />
</li>
<li>Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has introduced new phosphate standards
for the Wye and Usk catchments.<br />
</li>
<li>The appeal site is not on mains drainage; a <strong>private Vortex
ASP sewage treatment plant</strong> was proposed.<br />
</li>
<li>The appellant provided general information on the treatment plant
but <strong>no site-specific details</strong> on its location or
drainage field, and no soil/percolation testing data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inspector’s conclusion:</strong> Due to limited evidence, the
proposal <strong>could have a significant effect on the River Usk
SAC</strong>, posing an unacceptable risk contrary to LDP Policy EP1 and
the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.</p>
<h3 id="other-matter">Other matter</h3>
<p>The proposal could create local jobs and provide accommodation for
visitors. However, the scale of the development means <strong>these
benefits do not outweigh the harm</strong> identified.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proposal <strong>fails to comply with countryside conversion
policies</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>The proposal <strong>poses an unacceptable risk to the River Usk
SAC</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>No overriding public benefits justify granting permission.<br />
</li>
<li>In accordance with the Well-Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act
2015, the decision supports sustainable development principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final decision:</strong> The appeal is
<strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="council-response">Council response</h2>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Monmouth Town Council Planning Committee met on Tuesday, 12th
August 2025, at 6.30 pm in the Roberts Room at Bridges. The meeting
covered several planning applications, updates on enforcement matters,
and ongoing projects affecting the town. Apologies were accepted from
Councillors Rugen-Hankey and Wilcock, and Cllr Brehany sent her
apologies during the meeting due to connectivity issues. No declarations
of interest were made by Committee members.</p>
<p>The minutes from the previous meeting held on 22nd July 2025 were
confirmed and signed as a true record. No members of the public
requested to speak during the meeting. There were no late payments for
approval. The Committee discussed four planning applications in
detail.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500728-at-3-4-drybridge-terrace">DM/2025/00728 at 3-4
Drybridge Terrace</h2>
<p>The first application, DM/2025/00728 at 3-4 Drybridge Terrace,
proposed a small single-storey rear extension. Concerns about the impact
on the historic property had been raised by the Georgian Group and
echoed by the Committee. However, the Committee felt that there was not
enough information to fully assess the potential effects on the heritage
of the building. As a result, they were unable to make a recommendation
and requested that the applicant provide additional information for
reconsultation.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500943-at-43-wonastow-road">DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow
Road</h2>
<p>The second application, DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow Road, involved
the demolition of two rear single-storey extensions and the construction
of a new single-storey and two-storey rear extension, with internal
alterations. The Committee considered the conditions recommended by
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the Ecological Report appropriate.
They recommended approval on the condition that the applicant follows
NRW recommendations, obtains a bat mitigation licence, and considers
adding bird boxes, particularly for Swifts, to support local
biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500868-at-the-ancre-hill-rockfield-road">DM/2025/00868 at
The Ancre Hill, Rockfield Road</h2>
<p>The third application, DM/2025/00868 at The Ancre Hill, Rockfield
Road, proposed converting existing outbuildings into a single dwelling.
The Committee noted the bat survey recommendations and found the design
suitable for the location. They recommended approval, provided the
applicant adheres to the conditions in the bat survey. The fourth
application, DM/2025/01022 at 40 Monnow Keep, proposed converting a
garage door into a solid wall with a window to create additional living
accommodation. While the potential impact on parking was considered, it
was not relevant for this existing property. The Committee recommended
approval of the application.</p>
<p>The Committee also received an update from the Derelict Buildings
Working Group. The Buildings At Risk Officer for Monmouthshire County
Council, appointed on 29th July 2025, will liaise with Cllr Brehany
regarding ongoing concerns. During the review of the Action Summary, the
Committee noted the recent demolition of some buildings at Troy Station,
discussed the proposed design of the former Gate House pub, and
considered a public concern regarding paving slab colours at St Thomas
Garden, where the original Monmouth stone is no longer available. It was
noted that the Peacocks building has been purchased. Businesses and the
Chamber of Commerce will meet with County Councillor Paul Griffiths
regarding scaffolding at 10 Church Street. The Barton has now reopened
and has been removed from the Action Summary.</p>
<p>The Chairperson did not provide a report at this meeting. For future
discussions, the Committee agreed to include consultation on the
Wonastow Road footpath closure on the next agenda and to add information
about Swifts to the Town Council’s website to support local biodiversity
awareness. The next Planning Committee meeting is scheduled for Tuesday,
2nd September 2025.</p>]]></description>

<pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed two appeals relating to North
Barn at Whitehouse Farm, Llanvair Grange Road, Llanfair Kilgeddin,
Monmouthshire (NP7 9BB). The decisions were issued by JP Tudor BA
(Hons), Solicitor (non-practising), acting as an Inspector appointed by
the Welsh Ministers.</p>
<p>The appeals followed the refusal of planning permission and listed
building consent by Monmouthshire County Council in January 2025.</p>
<h2 id="appeal-details">Appeal details</h2>
<h3 id="appeal-a">Appeal A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-04103-G9V3H0<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Emma Dymond<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Appeal:</strong> Planning permission under section
78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> New single-storey rear lean-to oak-framed
extension, new opening providing access from kitchen into extension,
internal alterations for open-plan living space<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/01510 (dated 6 December
2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council Decision:</strong> Refused 22 January 2025<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site Visit:</strong> 18 June 2025</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="appeal-b">Appeal B</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-04104-P3D7Y2<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Emma Dymond<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Appeal:</strong> Listed building consent under
section 100 of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Same as Appeal A<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/01511 (dated 6 December
2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council Decision:</strong> Refused 22 January 2025<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site Visit:</strong> 18 June 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Both appeals were
<strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-matters">Preliminary matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Council did not object to most internal alterations to create an
open-plan living space.<br />
</li>
<li>A Heritage Impact Statement (HIS) noted that previous conversions in
the 1990s–2000s had already altered the interior, and further minor
changes would not adversely affect historic character.<br />
</li>
<li>Planning permission and listed building consent had already been
granted for a similar scheme (DM/2024/01508 &amp; DM/2024/01509),
differing only in the size of the opening from the kitchen into the
extension.<br />
</li>
<li>The main dispute concerned <strong>the size of the opening in the
external wall</strong> of North Barn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-issue">Main issue</h2>
<p>The Inspector identified the primary issue as whether the proposed
development <strong>preserves the special architectural and historic
interest</strong> of Whitehouse Farmhouse, a Grade II listed
building.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>North Barn: former agricultural threshing barn, part of a group
including South Barn and the Coach House.<br />
</li>
<li>While not individually listed, North Barn is
<strong>curtilage-listed</strong> and enjoys the same level of statutory
protection as Whitehouse Farmhouse under s76(5) of the Historic
Environment (Wales) Act 2023.<br />
</li>
<li>Legal framework: Sections 314A of the Town and Country Planning Act
1990 and Section 96 of the 2023 Act require <strong>special regard to
preserving listed buildings</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Relevant policy: Planning Policy Wales (PPW, Edition 12) and
Technical Advice Note 24 (TAN 24) on the historic environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="significance-of-the-site">Significance of the site</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whitehouse Farmhouse:</strong> early 17th-century Grade II
listed building with much original form and period detailing.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>North Barn:</strong> rubble stone former threshing barn,
possibly 18th century, converted to residential use circa 2000. Retains
significance as a substantial agricultural building and part of the
farmstead associated with Whitehouse Farmhouse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assessment-of-effects">Assessment of effects</h2>
<h3 id="lean-to-extension">1. Lean-to extension:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small ancillary lean-to structures are sometimes found on similar
agricultural buildings.<br />
</li>
<li>Size, scale, materials (oak finish, natural slate roof), and
set-back from the main barn are largely acceptable.<br />
</li>
<li>Extension is potentially reversible and already benefits from extant
consent.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disputed-kitchen-opening">2. Disputed kitchen opening:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proposed wide opening in the external wall would remove:
<ul>
<li>One of two arrow slit vents<br />
</li>
<li>A modern window from previous conversion<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Council and Cadw identified <strong>heritage harm</strong>, as the
opening would:
<ul>
<li>Remove historic fabric<br />
</li>
<li>Be uncharacteristic for a threshing barn<br />
</li>
<li>Diminish evidential value of arrow slit vent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="appellant-argument">3. Appellant argument:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removal of modern, unsympathetic window could improve overall
elevation.<br />
</li>
<li>Acknowledged heritage impact but argued magnitude would be low due
to prior conversions.<br />
</li>
<li>Argued new opening would be partly concealed by lean-to
extension.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inspectors-findings">4. Inspector’s findings:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visibility aside, <strong>heritage harm exists due to loss of
historic fabric and arrow slit vent</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Wide opening is untypical for traditional threshing barns.<br />
</li>
<li>Previous alterations do not justify further harm.<br />
</li>
<li>Views and setting of Whitehouse Farmhouse would not be directly
affected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cadw’s representations raised broader objections, including the
lean-to extension itself, but these elements already benefit from
consent and were <strong>not a deciding factor</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>No substantial public or community benefits arise from the proposed
works. The lean-to extension could be constructed under existing
consents without impacting historic fabric.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Harm to listed building:</strong> Considerable weight given
statutory presumption in favour of preservation.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Policy conflict:</strong> Proposal conflicts with PPW, TAN
24, and Monmouthshire LDP policies DES1 and H4 regarding the historic
environment.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015:</strong> Decision
aligns with sustainable development principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Decision:</strong> Both Appeal A and Appeal B were
<strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>

<title>Abergavenny restaurant sign dispute sparks heritage row </title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>A retrospective bid to keep two illuminated fascia signs at a popular
Abergavenny restaurant has divided opinion — with planning officers
recommending refusal but councillors voting to defer a final
decision.</p>
<p>The application, lodged by Mr Peter Woolley for <strong>Il
Gusto</strong> at <strong>43 Frogmore Street</strong>, sought to retain
two internally illuminated signs already installed on the shopfront. The
site lies in the <strong>Abergavenny Conservation Area</strong>, within
the town’s historic core and close to several listed buildings,
including the Baptist Church and the War Memorial.</p>
<p>The planning meeting where this was decided can be viewed on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=EBiA2bO-4m65F3Xq&amp;t=5329">YouTube</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h2>
<p>The two fascia signs, each around 3 metres wide and 0.6 metres high,
feature <strong>white text on a black PVC background</strong>. They are
static, internally lit, with a brightness of <strong>300 cd/m²</strong>,
and sit above the restaurant frontage at a height of 2.65 metres.</p>
<p>The application is <strong>retrospective</strong>, as the signs have
already been fitted without formal consent. Earlier permissions for the
site (2015) had allowed only <strong>externally illuminated
signage</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-the-signs">Support for the signs</h2>
<p>The application has received <strong>12 neighbour comments</strong>,
all supportive. Local residents and customers described the signs as
<em>“tasteful”</em>, <em>“elegant”</em>, and <em>“in keeping with the
town’s character”</em>.</p>
<p>Supporters argued the signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help small businesses stand out in the evening economy</li>
<li>Contribute to a vibrant town centre</li>
<li>Are no brighter than existing signage, including Tesco opposite</li>
<li>Compare favourably to other national chains that have been granted
internally lit signs in Abergavenny</li>
</ul>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council and the Abergavenny &amp; District Civic
Society also backed the application, stressing the need for
<strong>consistency</strong> and updated guidance for shopfronts in
conservation areas.</p>
<p>Local councillor Laura Wright also weighed in, calling the signage
<em>“not problematic within the conservation area”</em>. She said
illumination levels were modest, switched off at 10pm, and no different
to signage that had been in place at the site for years. <em>“Supporting
local businesses in our town centre is vital,”</em> she added.</p>
<h2 id="heritage-and-officer-concerns">Heritage and officer
concerns</h2>
<p>Despite this, <strong>Monmouthshire County Council’s heritage
officers</strong> strongly opposed the scheme. They argued that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internally illuminated PVC signage is <strong>modern and out of
keeping</strong> with the Conservation Area.</li>
<li>Conservation policy favours <strong>matt finishes and traditional
materials</strong> like timber.</li>
<li>The shiny finish and internal lighting make the signs <em>“starkly
modern”</em> and intrusive against nearby historic shopfronts.</li>
</ul>
<p>They suggested a compromise: disconnecting the internal lights and
replacing the glossy fascia with a <strong>matt wrap and external
downlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Planning officers echoed these concerns, citing <strong>Local
Development Plan policies DES3 and HE3</strong>, which require signage
in conservation areas to preserve character. They concluded the signs
had a <strong>“detrimental impact”</strong> on the appearance of the
historic core, particularly when lit at night.</p>
<h2 id="the-committee-debate">The committee debate</h2>
<p>At committee, officers recommended refusal. But councillors were
split. Some argued the rules were being applied too harshly to an
independent business, particularly given the presence of other
illuminated signage nearby.</p>
<p>When put to the vote, the motion to refuse failed — <strong>5 in
favour, 9 against</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, members resolved to <strong>defer</strong> the decision.
Officers were asked to negotiate with the applicant’s agent to find a
compromise, likely involving adjustments to the finish or lighting
method, before bringing the case back with a <strong>recommendation for
approval with conditions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2>
<p>The fate of Il Gusto’s signs now hangs in the balance. The restaurant
can continue trading with the current signage in place while discussions
continue.</p>
<p>If a compromise is agreed, councillors are expected to approve the
signs at a future meeting, bringing an end to a row that has highlighted
the <strong>tension between conservation rules and the needs of modern
businesses</strong> in Abergavenny’s town centre.</p>]]></description>

<title>Monmouthshire Council approves major speed limit changes across county</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide-ranging set of
Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) designed to improve road safety,
clarify existing speed limits, and ensure that local speed limits comply
with national regulations. The decisions were made during the Individual
Cabinet Member Decision meeting on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00
pm.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Member for Climate Change and the Environment confirmed
that a public inquiry would <strong>not</strong> be held, and that the
proposed orders would proceed as planned. Two proposals on the B4293,
Mitchell Troy, were not approved due to technical errors and will be
reviewed in the future.</p>
<h2 id="approved-speed-limit-changes">Approved Speed Limit Changes</h2>
<p>The Council approved the following speed limit changes across the
county:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redbrook Road, A466, Monmouth:</strong> A <strong>30mph
speed limit</strong> to correct a historical administrative omission.
This section was intended to operate at 30mph but was never formally
included in the legal Traffic Regulation Orders.</li>
<li><strong>A472, The Rhadyr, Usk:</strong> <strong>40mph and 30mph
limits</strong> to improve safety around the industrial BAE Systems site
and the nearby equine college, where slow-moving vehicles and pedestrian
traffic create higher risk.</li>
<li><strong>B4233, The Hendre:</strong> <strong>30mph limit</strong> to
match the residential character of the area and current national speed
limit policy.</li>
<li><strong>B4233/B4347 Junction, Rockfield:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> in a residential area with high pedestrian activity and a
complex junction layout.</li>
<li><strong>B4233, Monmouth to Rockfield:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> to create a gradual speed transition between 20mph zones,
reducing sudden changes in speed that could pose risks.</li>
<li><strong>Mitchell Troy Road, Raglan:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> to improve safety in a residential area with bends,
visibility issues, and multiple property access points.</li>
<li><strong>Staunton Road, A4136:</strong> <strong>40mph limit</strong>
in response to a collision cluster, including one fatality between 2020
and 2023.</li>
<li><strong>B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd Bach:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> extended across severe bends to address a documented
collision cluster with ten recorded incidents between 2020 and
2023.</li>
<li><strong>B4596, Llancayo:</strong> <strong>30mph buffer
zones</strong> to provide a smoother speed transition from 50mph roads
to 20mph restricted areas.</li>
<li><strong>Common Road, Mitchell Troy:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> formalised to correct an administrative oversight and
ensure legal enforceability.</li>
<li><strong>Conway Drive, Chepstow:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> replaces a short national speed limit section, creating a
consistent speed transition into the 20mph residential area.</li>
<li><strong>A466, Llandogo:</strong> Existing <strong>20mph limit
revoked</strong> to remove a redundant order; the road remains 20mph
under default regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Lane from B4293 to Park House, Itton Common:</strong>
<strong>20mph limit</strong> formalised to match existing signage and
practice.</li>
<li><strong>Crick Road, Portskewett:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> extended to cover new pedestrian infrastructure linked to
a housing development.</li>
<li><strong>B4235, Gwernesney:</strong> <strong>30mph and 40mph
limits</strong> to improve safety in the residential area and provide a
graduated transition from national speed limits.</li>
<li><strong>A466, Tintern:</strong> <strong>20mph limit</strong>
formalised to ensure compliance where sections lacked statutory backing
despite being signed as 20mph.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speed-limit-orders-not-approved">Speed limit orders not
approved</h2>
<p>The Council decided <strong>not</strong> to proceed with the
following proposals on the B4293, Mitchell Troy:</p>
<ul>
<li>40mph speed limit</li>
<li>50mph speed limit</li>
</ul>
<p>These proposals contained errors in the technical drawings, and the
Council plans to review these sections in a future consultation.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-changes-were-made">Why the changes were made</h2>
<p>The Council explained that the changes were needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address safety concerns, including areas with documented collisions
and high pedestrian activity.</li>
<li>Correct administrative and legal inconsistencies in previous Traffic
Regulation Orders.</li>
<li>Align local speed limits with national policy, including the 20mph
default for restricted roads in Wales.</li>
<li>Provide clear and enforceable speed limits to reduce confusion for
drivers.</li>
<li>Promote safer, more sustainable travel options such as walking and
cycling.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redbrook Road, Monmouth:</strong> A 30mph limit formalises
the existing arrangement for legal certainty.</li>
<li><strong>A472, Usk:</strong> 40mph and 30mph limits respond to
slow-moving industrial and equine traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Staunton Road, A4136 &amp; B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd
Bach:</strong> New limits are based on collision data to reduce
risk.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer zones (B4596, Llancayo) and residential areas
(Rockfield, The Hendre, Gwernesney):</strong> Smoother transitions and
lower speeds protect vulnerable road users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-communities">Impact on communities</h2>
<p>The Council highlighted that these changes will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve safety for children, the elderly, and people with
disabilities.</li>
<li>Encourage active and sustainable travel by making walking and

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide-ranging set of
Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) designed to improve road safety,
clarify existing speed limits, and ensure that local speed limits comply
with national regulations. The decisions were made during the Individual
Cabinet Member Decision meeting on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00
pm.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Member for Climate Change and the Environment confirmed
that a public inquiry would <strong>not</strong> be held, and that the
proposed orders would proceed as planned. Two proposals on the B4293,
Mitchell Troy, were not approved due to technical errors and will be
reviewed in the future.</p>
<h2 id="approved-speed-limit-changes">Approved Speed Limit Changes</h2>
<p>The Council approved the following speed limit changes across the
county:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redbrook Road, A466, Monmouth:</strong> A <strong>30mph
speed limit</strong> to correct a historical administrative omission.
This section was intended to operate at 30mph but was never formally
included in the legal Traffic Regulation Orders.</li>
<li><strong>A472, The Rhadyr, Usk:</strong> <strong>40mph and 30mph
limits</strong> to improve safety around the industrial BAE Systems site
and the nearby equine college, where slow-moving vehicles and pedestrian
traffic create higher risk.</li>
<li><strong>B4233, The Hendre:</strong> <strong>30mph limit</strong> to
match the residential character of the area and current national speed
limit policy.</li>
<li><strong>B4233/B4347 Junction, Rockfield:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> in a residential area with high pedestrian activity and a
complex junction layout.</li>
<li><strong>B4233, Monmouth to Rockfield:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> to create a gradual speed transition between 20mph zones,
reducing sudden changes in speed that could pose risks.</li>
<li><strong>Mitchell Troy Road, Raglan:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> to improve safety in a residential area with bends,
visibility issues, and multiple property access points.</li>
<li><strong>Staunton Road, A4136:</strong> <strong>40mph limit</strong>
in response to a collision cluster, including one fatality between 2020
and 2023.</li>
<li><strong>B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd Bach:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> extended across severe bends to address a documented
collision cluster with ten recorded incidents between 2020 and
2023.</li>
<li><strong>B4596, Llancayo:</strong> <strong>30mph buffer
zones</strong> to provide a smoother speed transition from 50mph roads
to 20mph restricted areas.</li>
<li><strong>Common Road, Mitchell Troy:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> formalised to correct an administrative oversight and
ensure legal enforceability.</li>
<li><strong>Conway Drive, Chepstow:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> replaces a short national speed limit section, creating a
consistent speed transition into the 20mph residential area.</li>
<li><strong>A466, Llandogo:</strong> Existing <strong>20mph limit
revoked</strong> to remove a redundant order; the road remains 20mph
under default regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Lane from B4293 to Park House, Itton Common:</strong>
<strong>20mph limit</strong> formalised to match existing signage and
practice.</li>
<li><strong>Crick Road, Portskewett:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> extended to cover new pedestrian infrastructure linked to
a housing development.</li>
<li><strong>B4235, Gwernesney:</strong> <strong>30mph and 40mph
limits</strong> to improve safety in the residential area and provide a
graduated transition from national speed limits.</li>
<li><strong>A466, Tintern:</strong> <strong>20mph limit</strong>
formalised to ensure compliance where sections lacked statutory backing
despite being signed as 20mph.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speed-limit-orders-not-approved">Speed limit orders not
approved</h2>
<p>The Council decided <strong>not</strong> to proceed with the
following proposals on the B4293, Mitchell Troy:</p>
<ul>
<li>40mph speed limit</li>
<li>50mph speed limit</li>
</ul>
<p>These proposals contained errors in the technical drawings, and the
Council plans to review these sections in a future consultation.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-changes-were-made">Why the changes were made</h2>
<p>The Council explained that the changes were needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address safety concerns, including areas with documented collisions
and high pedestrian activity.</li>
<li>Correct administrative and legal inconsistencies in previous Traffic
Regulation Orders.</li>
<li>Align local speed limits with national policy, including the 20mph
default for restricted roads in Wales.</li>
<li>Provide clear and enforceable speed limits to reduce confusion for
drivers.</li>
<li>Promote safer, more sustainable travel options such as walking and
cycling.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redbrook Road, Monmouth:</strong> A 30mph limit formalises
the existing arrangement for legal certainty.</li>
<li><strong>A472, Usk:</strong> 40mph and 30mph limits respond to
slow-moving industrial and equine traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Staunton Road, A4136 &amp; B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd
Bach:</strong> New limits are based on collision data to reduce
risk.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer zones (B4596, Llancayo) and residential areas
(Rockfield, The Hendre, Gwernesney):</strong> Smoother transitions and
lower speeds protect vulnerable road users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-communities">Impact on communities</h2>
<p>The Council highlighted that these changes will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve safety for children, the elderly, and people with
disabilities.</li>
<li>Encourage active and sustainable travel by making walking and
cycling safer.</li>
<li>Provide legally enforceable speed limits across the county.</li>
<li>Support social justice, safeguarding, and community cohesion in line
with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="funding-and-next-steps">Funding and next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The changes will be funded by Monmouthshire County Council’s Road
Safety and Traffic Management budget and the Welsh Government Road
Safety Grant.</li>
<li>Implementation will begin soon, with new signage and formal Traffic
Regulation Orders being put in place.</li>
<li>Residents are encouraged to follow the new speed limits and continue
reporting safety concerns to the Council.</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a new <strong>40mph speed
limit</strong> on Staunton Road (A4136) following a detailed engineering
assessment and community consultation. The decision was part of the
Individual Cabinet Member Decision meeting held on Wednesday, 20th
August 2025 at 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>The change is aimed at addressing urgent safety concerns on this
strategic route, which connects Monmouth to Gloucestershire and carries
a variety of vehicles, including heavy goods traffic, with limited
alternative routes.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-change-was-needed">Why the change was needed</h2>
<p>An engineering assessment highlighted that the existing speed limit
on Staunton Road is <strong>inappropriate for the road’s geometry and
traffic conditions</strong>. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>documented collision cluster</strong> between Wyesham and
the county boundary, with <strong>five recorded collisions between 2020
and 2023</strong>, including one fatality.<br />
</li>
<li>The road is heavily used by a range of vehicles, some of which are
large, including heavy goods vehicles, creating higher safety risks at
current speeds.<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>poor road condition</strong> further increases the risk
of accidents, making a lower speed limit necessary for safe
navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council concluded that a 40mph limit is the safest option for
this section of road and will help prevent future collisions.</p>
<h2 id="support-from-local-community">Support from local community</h2>
<p>Monmouth Town Council has expressed support for the proposed TRO.
They highlighted that Staunton Road is used by a variety of vehicles,
including large vehicles, and that <strong>slower speeds will improve
safety for all road users</strong>. The Council also noted that the
road’s current condition requires careful navigation, which is better
managed under a lower speed limit.</p>
<h2 id="expected-benefits">Expected benefits</h2>
<p>The introduction of the 40mph limit on Staunton Road is expected to
have several positive impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved safety for all road users</strong> by reducing the
likelihood and severity of collisions.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Health benefits for the community</strong>, as fewer
accidents reduce the burden on emergency services and healthcare
providers.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency with wider road safety measures</strong> across
Monmouthshire, particularly in areas with documented collision clusters
such as Staunton Road and the B4235 between Chepstow and Mynydd
Bach.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Better traffic management</strong>, particularly for heavy
goods vehicles using this strategic route.</li>
</ul>
<p>Council officers noted that these changes are part of a wider
programme to create a safer, more consistent speed limit framework
across the county and to support sustainable travel where possible.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 40mph speed limit will be formally implemented as part of the
Monmouthshire County Council Traffic Regulation, Speed Limits, and
Parking Regulations Consolidation Order 2019 (Amendment Order
No. 17).<br />
</li>
<li>New signage will be installed, and the TRO will be legally
enforceable to ensure compliance.<br />
</li>
<li>Residents and road users are encouraged to observe the new limit and
continue reporting safety concerns to the Council.</li>

<title>Llancayo Travellers’ site approved after long dispute over flooding and drainage</title>

<pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A long-running planning saga at Llancayo, near Usk, has ended with
approval for a Travellers’ site — almost a decade after the family first
moved onto the land without consent.</p>
<p>The planning meeting was made available on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=S9hUGzBfLcEedUlq&amp;t=4178">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council’s planning committee confirmed its
decision this summer to allow <strong>four family-related
pitches</strong> on land opposite Llancayo House, despite strong
opposition from the local community council and some neighbours.</p>
<p>The development will provide each pitch with a static caravan, a
touring caravan, and a day/utility room, together with ecological
enhancements, new landscaping, and an emergency flood access. A new
<strong>biological treatment plant</strong> and drainage system have
been designed to address earlier concerns about pollution in the nearby
<strong>River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-history-of-disputes">A history of disputes</h2>
<p>The Jones and Purcell family, who are from the Gypsy and Traveller
community, have lived at the site since 2016. Their first planning
application for six pitches was refused later that year, citing its
location in open countryside, poor drainage, and highway safety
issues.</p>
<p>An enforcement notice was served requiring the family to leave, but
appeals to the Planning Inspectorate, the High Court, and the Court of
Appeal followed. The family remained on the site throughout.</p>
<p>The latest application scaled back the scheme from six to
<strong>four pitches</strong> and dropped earlier proposals for stables
and kennels. Officers said this reduction allowed more space for
drainage infrastructure and improved the site’s layout.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-scrutiny">Environmental scrutiny</h2>
<p>Because the site drains towards the River Usk, the proposal triggered
a full <strong>Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA)</strong>. Natural
Resources Wales (NRW) warned that untreated effluent could damage
protected fish species, including twaite and allis shad.</p>
<p>To meet strict rules on phosphates, the family’s agents submitted a
detailed <strong>Nutrient Neutrality Assessment and Mitigation
Strategy</strong>. This proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>GRAF One2Clean biological treatment plant</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>limestone filter bed</strong> to further strip out
phosphorus</li>
<li>A <strong>drainage field</strong> of at least 250m², tested to show
the ground can absorb wastewater</li>
</ul>
<p>The system was designed for up to 16–18 people — more than the likely
occupancy of 12 across the four pitches — giving what officers called
<em>“a comfortable margin of safety.”</em></p>
<p>NRW eventually accepted the calculations, concluding that, with
conditions in place, the project would <strong>not harm the River Usk
SAC</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="objections-and-concerns">Objections and concerns</h2>
<p>Despite the technical approvals, <strong>Llanarth Fawr Community
Council</strong> lodged strong objections. It argued that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drainage field is too small and sits on heavy mudstone that
could lead to effluent runoff</li>
<li>The site is close to flood zones, with the emergency escape route
itself predicted to flood in a 1-in-100 year event</li>
<li>The layout does not meet all safety standards in Welsh Government
guidance for Traveller sites</li>
</ul>
<p>The council warned the scheme could worsen local flooding and said
unmet need for Traveller sites should not override environmental
risks.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-need-and-impact">Balancing need and impact</h2>
<p>Planning officers acknowledged the objections but stressed
Monmouthshire has a legal duty to provide Traveller accommodation. Its
most recent <strong>Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation
Assessment</strong>, approved by Welsh Government in 2024, identified a
need for 13 additional pitches in the county.</p>
<p>They concluded the Llancayo site would help meet this need, and that
revised drainage, flood access, and ecological measures meant the scheme
now complied with planning policy.</p>
<h2 id="the-decision">The decision</h2>
<p>The planning committee first voted in July 2024 to approve the
application, subject to confirmation from Natural Resources Wales that
the site would not harm the River Usk SAC. That confirmation arrived in
summer 2025, allowing the council to formally grant permission.</p>
<p>The approval comes with conditions requiring the drainage system to
be installed and maintained as designed, ecological features (such as
bird and bat boxes) to be provided, and an emergency flood access to be
constructed.</p>
<p>While campaigners against the scheme remain disappointed, the family
now has security of tenure on the land they have occupied for nine
years.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Full Council – Monday 14th July 2025, 7pm–9:10pm</strong></p>
<p>Lydney Town Council met on Monday 14th July, with councillors
discussing highways, local developments, community assets, and plans for
town improvements.</p>
<h2 id="key-decisions-and-updates">Key decisions and updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highways and traffic</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cllr Howard met with the Lydney Highways Manager to discuss 2025/26
priorities. Speed surveys will be carried out in some areas, with the
potential for Vehicle Activated Signs (VAS) that display number plates
of speeding drivers.<br />
</li>
<li>Traffic light safety measures were also discussed: if a car runs a
red light, both sets of lights lock on red until reset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Local Development and Community Assets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates were given on Grove Lane development, with ecological
concerns possibly affecting plans.<br />
</li>
<li>The District Council confirmed that despite previous NHS objections,
changes in law mean the council could reapply to register the Newerne
Street GP Surgery as a Community Asset.<br />
</li>
<li>The council agreed <strong>not</strong> to re-register Lydney &amp;
District Hospital as a Community Asset at this time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forest gateway project</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cllr R Holmes reported on discussions with West Dean Parish Council.
Objections have been raised over ecology concerns, and independent
surveys of bats, dormice, flora, and fauna could cost around
£17,000.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Payments totalling <strong>£34,962.98</strong> were approved.<br />
</li>
<li>Income and expenditure reports, earmarked reserves, and bank
reconciliations were all approved.<br />
</li>
<li>VAT payments for Quarter 1 were noted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Committee reports and community issues</strong>
<ul>
<li>Anti-social behaviour at East Marsh continues to be a problem, with
reports of litter, fires, and camps.<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>Neighbourhood Development Plan (NDP)</strong>
consultation closes 22nd July, with further feedback to be gathered at
the Summer Community Event on 19th July. A follow-up Zoom meeting will
take place on 5th August.<br />
</li>
<li>Councillors were reminded to support the Summer Community Event,
which will feature pirate shows and craft activities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Strategic planning and policies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Strategic Plan 2023–2030 was updated, with some targets moving from
red to amber.<br />
</li>

potential for Vehicle Activated Signs (VAS) that display number plates
of speeding drivers.<br />

<ul>
<li>Updates were given on Grove Lane development, with ecological

District Hospital as a Community Asset at this time.</li>

<ul>
<li>Payments totalling <strong>£34,962.98</strong> were approved.<br />

reports of litter, fires, and camps.<br />
</li>

consultation closes 22nd July, with further feedback to be gathered at
the Summer Community Event on 19th July. A follow-up Zoom meeting will

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Full Council – Tuesday 8th July 2025, 7pm–9pm</strong></p>
<p>Coleford Town Council met on Tuesday 8th July with Councillors
discussing a wide range of community matters, from staff appraisals and
Active Travel projects to memorial benches and local awards.</p>
<h2 id="key-decisions-and-updates">Key Decisions and Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Staff appraisals</strong><br />
The Town Clerk confirmed that appraisals had been completed for the
Assistant Clerk and Administrator. Both will receive a one-point salary
increase in line with contracts. A review process will be looked into
for Admin Officer K Hughes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flag flying requests</strong><br />
Councillors agreed that in future the Union Flag should fly on the Clock
Tower throughout Armed Forces Week, while the Pride flag will be flown
either side of this week and for the whole of June at Bells
Field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active travel project</strong><br />
Progress was reported on the cycle and walking path. To manage costs,
the scheme will now be split into three phases, with work linked to
funding from the Rural England Prosperity Fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>CTC will fund the project, but long-term maintenance will remain
with the landowner (FoDDC).<br />
</li>
<li>The Co-op section will be held back for possible action later due to
high legal fees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rural England Prosperity Fund (REPF)
applications</strong><br />
Councillors discussed three potential projects, including a “pocket
park” with an industrial-meets-nature theme linked to the Railway
Museum. Local schools and artists may be involved in shaping the design.
The Council team has delegated authority to develop the
application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cemetery projects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised about water damage affecting the Cemetery
plinth mural. Councillors agreed to rethink the project and possibly
halt it if necessary.<br />
</li>
<li>A request for a memorial bench in the Garden of Remembrance was
approved, with the condition that it could be moved in future if the
area is extended.<br />
</li>
<li>A new noticeboard will be installed at the Cemetery, with an oak
frame and green background, subject to checking existing storage.<br />
</li>
<li>Councillors reaffirmed the policy that memorial benches are only
allowed in the Cemetery, not in the town centre.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other local matters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bench request in Sylvan Close was approved, with fencing to be
installed by TEK Fencing including anti-vandal wire.<br />
</li>
<li>Phone boxes: one in Coalway may be relocated within the parish,
while the Sunnybank box will be sold to Greenacres for £250, with
removal and land restoration to be completed within six months.<br />
</li>
<li>The King George V pavilion’s electrical safety certificate (EICR)
has been completed and urgent items addressed. The clock will also be
repaired.<br />
</li>
<li>A proposal for an Angus Buchanan bust was declined due to cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Speed limit review</strong><br />
Councillors will consider supporting 20mph zones where evidence or
statistics show a clear need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community &amp; awards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The GGP Community Builder scheme was deemed district-wide and not a
priority for CTC at present.<br />
</li>
<li>The Council decided not to fund sponsorship of the <em>Forest
Review</em> Local Heroes Mayor’s Award, as it duplicates Coleford’s own
community awards. However, they will nominate Erin Burke as “Sporting
Hero” and Cllr Nick Penny will attend.<br />
</li>
<li>Cllr M Getgood was nominated to speak at a forthcoming Climate
Adaptation Workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Citizen visioning</strong><br />
Six councillors attended the final presentation. While feedback was
mixed on the process, the passion of participants was noted. A formal
report is expected by the end of July.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Police update</strong><br />
Police statistics were noted. Concerns were raised about drug use and
dealing in the town. Coleford has been added to the national “Summer
Blitz” scheme.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Document Retention Policy will now keep safeguarding records for
30 years, in line with insurance requirements.<br />
</li>
<li>The Council adopted a new Expenses Policy, including mileage
incentives for car-sharing.</li>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Berry Hill Primary School in Coleford is celebrating after inspectors
rated the school <strong>“Good”</strong> in all areas following their
visit on <strong>3rd and 4th June 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The report marks a big step forward for the school, which was judged
as <em>“Requires Improvement”</em> at its last inspection in January
2023.</p>
<h2 id="strong-values-and-positive-atmosphere">Strong values and
positive atmosphere</h2>
<p>Inspectors praised the school’s ethos, built around the <strong>“3
Bs: be kind, be respectful, be your best.”</strong><br />
They found that pupils feel safe, happy, and eager to learn. Children
treat each other with kindness and respect, and enjoy taking on
responsibilities such as being house captains or members of the pupil
parliament.</p>
<p>The report also highlighted pupils’ <strong>tolerance and
compassion</strong>, noting that they understand discrimination is wrong
and support classmates who need extra help.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-school-does-well">What the school does well</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> Teachers have designed lessons that
reflect Berry Hill’s local context while also broadening pupils’
horizons. The curriculum is especially well thought out for children
with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> Children begin learning phonics as soon as
they join Reception. Most are fluent readers by the end of Year 2. Those
with speech and language difficulties are well supported to catch
up.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Maths:</strong> Results in 2024 were below average, but a
new approach has now strengthened pupils’ understanding. Inspectors saw
both younger and older children making good progress.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>SEND Support:</strong> Staff now identify pupils’ needs much
earlier and adapt lessons well. As a result, pupils with SEND achieve
strongly.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Pupils are encouraged to
become reflective, confident, and socially responsible.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Headteacher <strong>Amy Pugh</strong>
and her team were praised for their clear and ambitious vision, which
staff consistently follow. Governors, led by <strong>Tracey
Johnson</strong>, were said to have an accurate view of the school’s
strengths and areas for growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-to-improve">Areas to improve</h2>
<p>Inspectors also noted areas where the school still needs to
improve:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Deeper Learning:</strong> Sometimes pupils are not
challenged enough to extend their knowledge.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Handwriting, spelling, and punctuation are
not taught consistently well, meaning some pupils keep repeating
errors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Early Years:</strong> In Reception, children do not always
get enough chances to apply skills across different areas of learning,
which can affect preparation for Year 1.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="early-years-and-beyond">Early years and beyond</h2>
<p>Children in Reception get a strong start in reading, writing, and
maths, though inspectors said they sometimes miss out on wider
opportunities.<br />
Across the school, behaviour was described as good, with only occasional
fussiness that is quickly managed by staff.</p>
<h2 id="safeguarding">Safeguarding</h2>
<p>Safeguarding arrangements were found to be
<strong>effective</strong>, with inspectors confident that children’s
welfare is a top priority.</p>
<h2 id="school-details">School details</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headteacher:</strong> Amy Pugh<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Chair of Governors:</strong> Tracey Johnson<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Foundation Primary School<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Age Range:</strong> 4–11<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Pupils on roll:</strong> 204<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Address:</strong> Nine Wells Road, Berry Hill, Coleford,
GL16 7AT<br />

</ul>
<p>Berry Hill Primary has made clear progress since its last inspection.
With strong leadership, a positive culture, and new improvements already
underway, the school is set to continue its journey of success.</p>]]></description>

earlier and adapt lessons well. As a result, pupils with SEND achieve
strongly.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Pupils are encouraged to
become reflective, confident, and socially responsible.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Headteacher <strong>Amy Pugh</strong>
and her team were praised for their clear and ambitious vision, which
staff consistently follow. Governors, led by <strong>Tracey
Johnson</strong>, were said to have an accurate view of the school’s
strengths and areas for growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-to-improve">Areas to improve</h2>
<p>Inspectors also noted areas where the school still needs to
improve:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Deeper Learning:</strong> Sometimes pupils are not
challenged enough to extend their knowledge.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Handwriting, spelling, and punctuation are
not taught consistently well, meaning some pupils keep repeating
errors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Early Years:</strong> In Reception, children do not always
get enough chances to apply skills across different areas of learning,
which can affect preparation for Year 1.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="early-years-and-beyond">Early years and beyond</h2>
<p>Children in Reception get a strong start in reading, writing, and
maths, though inspectors said they sometimes miss out on wider
opportunities.<br />
Across the school, behaviour was described as good, with only occasional
fussiness that is quickly managed by staff.</p>
<h2 id="safeguarding">Safeguarding</h2>
<p>Safeguarding arrangements were found to be
<strong>effective</strong>, with inspectors confident that children’s
welfare is a top priority.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Whitchurch CofE Primary School, near Ross-on-Wye, has been praised by
Ofsted inspectors following their visit on <strong>25th and 26th March
2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The school, which had not been fully inspected since 2012, has been
judged <strong>“Good”</strong> in education, behaviour, personal
development, and leadership – with its <strong>Early Years provision
rated “Outstanding.”</strong></p>
<h2 id="warm-and-inclusive-community">Warm and inclusive community</h2>
<p>Inspectors described Whitchurch as a <strong>welcoming and inclusive
school</strong> with high expectations. Children receive an excellent
start in the Early Years, where they quickly become independent,
curious, and confident learners.</p>
<p>Pupils were found to behave well, showing <strong>trust, kindness,
and friendship</strong> in their daily interactions. They are polite,
well-mannered, and keen to learn. Staff make sure pupils feel safe and
listened to, creating a culture of <strong>support and
care</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-school-does-well">What the school does well</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> Ambitious and broad, designed to build
pupils’ knowledge over time. Reading and maths lessons follow a clear
structure, helping pupils revisit, learn new content, and practise
regularly.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> A strong priority from the start. Phonics
is taught consistently by skilled staff, and books match children’s
reading levels. Those who fall behind receive quick support.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>SEND Support:</strong> Pupils with special educational needs
and/or disabilities are identified early and supported effectively. They
learn alongside their peers and achieve well.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Early Years:</strong> Rated <em>Outstanding</em>. Teachers
know each child well and tailor learning to their needs. A strong focus
on language and communication gives children the vocabulary and
confidence they need. Pupils develop excellent concentration and
learning behaviours.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Pupils are well prepared for
life in modern Britain, learning about respect, tolerance, online
safety, and healthy living. Leadership opportunities, such as the School
Parliament, give pupils a real voice – including helping to interview
new staff.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Staff and Leadership:</strong> Teachers and support staff
say morale is high. Headteacher <strong>Beth Stevens</strong> was
praised for her leadership, and governors, led by <strong>Ione
Taylor</strong>, were recognised for knowing the school well and
providing strong support and challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-to-improve">Areas to improve</h2>
<p>Inspectors highlighted two main areas for further improvement:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Curriculum Implementation:</strong> In some subjects,
teaching does not fully match the school’s intentions. This means pupils
do not always make strong connections between topics.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Checking Understanding:</strong> Sometimes misconceptions
are not corrected quickly enough, so pupils can repeat errors. The
school needs to strengthen systems for checking what children know and
remember.</li>
</ol>

<title>Coalway Community Infant School making progress, says Ofsted</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Coalway Community Infant School has been praised for improvements in
teaching and behaviour, following a <strong>monitoring inspection on
19th March 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The visit, led by His Majesty’s Inspector <strong>Nicky
McMahon</strong>, found that while the school still has work to do,
leaders have taken <strong>positive steps since the last full
inspection</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-in-teaching-and-learning">Improvements in teaching
and learning</h2>
<p>Reading and phonics have been made a <strong>top priority</strong>.
Staff have received extra training, and phonics lessons are now taught
more consistently. Checks on pupils’ reading help teachers to spot gaps
early and provide extra support.</p>
<p>Work to improve <strong>writing</strong> is the next step, with
leaders recognising its importance for progress across all subjects.</p>
<p>In the wider curriculum, the school has identified key knowledge for
pupils to learn and has started using new systems to check what children
remember. This is helping to fill gaps, though inspectors said there is
still <strong>more work needed</strong> to make sure teaching and
assessment are consistent in all subjects.</p>
<p>In <strong>early years</strong>, the curriculum has been
strengthened, especially around language development and the learning
environment. However, these changes are still new and need more time to
embed.</p>
<h2 id="behaviour-and-atmosphere">Behaviour and atmosphere</h2>
<p>Inspectors reported that the school is now <strong>calm and
orderly</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staff share clear expectations for behaviour.<br />
</li>
<li>Pupils understand the rules and show <strong>positive attitudes to
learning</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Disruptions in class are now minimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The school is also starting to adapt its approach to better meet the
needs of all pupils.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>The report highlighted that many improvements are still at an
<strong>early stage</strong>. Leaders need clearer plans and timescales
to track progress more effectively. Governors are ambitious and
supportive, but many are new to their roles and still developing their
impact.</p>
<p>Coalway is working closely with external advisors and the local
authority and has shown it is open to advice and support.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Ofsted concluded that <strong>“Leaders have made progress to improve
the school, but some aspects need further improvement.”</strong></p>
<p>Parents and carers can be reassured that the school is moving in the
right direction, with strong foundations now being put in place for the
future.</p>]]></description>
