---

Monmouthshire County Council has approved a number of planning applications in recent weeks, covering refurbishment, renovations, and property extensions across the county.

At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent. The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the existing timber cupola on the main roof, as part of the ongoing preservation of the historic property.

In Grosmont, modifications to an earlier planning approval at Broome Villa, Hand Road were approved. The work involves extending, improving, and remodelling the detached house and outbuildings, as well as creating a new vehicular access and parking area for the property.

Meanwhile, at Merrig Mill, Tregagle, Trellech, a series of renovations and small-scale construction projects were approved. The plans cover three projects, conversion of an existing single-storey stone outbuilding, formerly a stable, into a bedroom and shower room; construction of a new small stable attached to the south side of the ancillary barn; and renovation of an existing barn within the domestic curtilage for personal residential use.

At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent. The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the timber cupola, a small decorative structure on the top of the main roof that provides ventilation and adds architectural character to the historic building.

All decisions were issued between 26 and 27 August 2025.
