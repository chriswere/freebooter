title: Ambitious plans for Five Acres laid out by council
---

The Forest of Dean District Council has unveiled an ambitious new vision for **Five Acres** in Berry Hill, creating a hub of leisure, education, and community activities for residents across the district. The project is designed to bring people together, provide modern facilities, and support the health and wellbeing of the local community.

## Phase One: Indoor Facilities and Community Spaces

The first phase of the redevelopment focuses on the **refurbishment of the former Speedwell Building** and the creation of new indoor leisure facilities. Plans include:  

- A **large 53-station gym** for all ages and abilities  
- **Power-assisted exercise rooms** and group exercise space  
- **Soft play areas** and party rooms for children  
- A **café** for visitors  
- Repurposed upper floors of the Speedwell Building for **office and community space**  
- A dedicated **outreach space for Hartpury University’s Aspiration Centre**  
- **New car parking** and a secure **cycle parking facility**  

The designs have been carefully developed with input from residents and community groups, ensuring that the facilities meet local needs while remaining **financially and environmentally sustainable**. Energy-efficient features such as **air source heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, and electric vehicle charging points** are included to ensure a long-term positive impact.

## Phase Two: Outdoor Sports Facilities

The second phase focuses on the **3G artificial pitch**, which will include:  

- A **full-size pitch** suitable for football and rugby training and competitive games  
- **Floodlights and spectator area**  
- Compliance with **World Rugby Reg22 standards**  

This phase is part of a successful funding bid to the **Football Association** in January 2025. A **planning application (P0087/25/FUL)** has been submitted and is under consideration.  

The pitch location has been carefully chosen due to site constraints such as a capped mining shaft and tree root protection zones. It is designed to meet the growing demand for 3G pitches in the district, which currently has a shortfall of two full-size pitches for local teams.

## Future Expansion and Flexibility

Although the initial plans do not include a swimming pool or new tennis courts, the design leaves **space for future expansion**. The Sports Hall has been reoriented, and corridors included to allow for potential future facilities without disrupting current operations.  

A **small performance venue** will be included in the Sports Hall, allowing for exhibitions, static displays, or live performances. Retractable bleacher seating for up to 450 people could be added in future phases if funding becomes available.

The athletics track, owned by Five Acres High School, could be upgraded in the future with support from the council and advice from England Athletics.

## Education and Community Partnerships

Hartpury University and College will **lease two rooms** within the refurbished Speedwell Building for its **Aspiration Centre**, creating a local outreach hub. This centre will provide programmes and activities aimed at:  

- Raising aspirations among young people in the Forest of Dean  
- Promoting further and higher education opportunities  
- Supporting business and employer pathways  

The partnership with Hartpury also aims to **reduce travel and carbon emissions** for students by bringing education closer to home.  

## Funding and Redevelopment

The redevelopment is being funded by the council through a **successful Levelling Up Fund bid**, which also supports:  

- A **flagship University, Careers & Enterprise Learning Centre** and electric vehicle car park at Hartpury  
- Transformation of **three prominent buildings in Cinderford town centre** to support businesses, social enterprises, training, and the arts  

The council purchased the Five Acres site from **Homes England in December 2021 for £1**, with the goal of creating a new council-owned leisure and community destination. Demolition of the previous structures has been completed, and the site is now cleared and ready for construction.

## Community Consultation

Early consultation events were held at **Berry Hill Primary School** and **Five Acres High School**, helping shape the phased design approach. Further community information events will be organised as the project progresses, keeping residents updated on plans for both indoor and outdoor facilities.

## Long-Term Vision

The council’s vision for Five Acres is to create a **hub for community activity** with:  

- Sports and leisure facilities for all ages  
- Spaces for socialising and community groups  
- Opportunities for small businesses to start or grow  
- Potential for a hotel to support local tourism in future phases  

The project aligns with the **Allocations Plan** and the **Berry Hill, Christchurch, and Edge End Neighbourhood Plan**, ensuring it meets local planning and community objectives.

## Key Facts About Facilities

- **Swimming pool**: No current plans due to lack of funding. Space is reserved for future development.  
- **Tennis courts**: Currently in poor condition; future upgrades will depend on user demand and funding. Multi-use options for basketball or netball may be considered.  
- **3G pitch**: Designed for full-size football and rugby, with planned community use from 5-9pm weekdays and potential daytime school use.  
- **Sports Hall**: Multi-purpose space for badminton, football, or community events, with flexible line markings and potential retractable seating.
