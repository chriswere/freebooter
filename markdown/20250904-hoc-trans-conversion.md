title: Monmouth MP presses Government for ban on trans conversion therapy
---
MP for Monmouth Catherine Fookes, spoke in the House of Commons debate in support of trans people. She raised the Governmentâ€™s commitment to a **full trans-inclusive ban on conversion therapy** and asked when legislation would be introduced to bring the practice to an end.

**Bridget Phillipson**, Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities, responded that a draft Bill was being prepared to deliver this commitment. She described conversion practices as unacceptable and confirmed that the legislation would follow the manifesto promise.

Earlier in the debate, **Ian Sollom**, Liberal Democrat spokesperson, had highlighted that some trans people with gender recognition certificates face conflicting obligations: they are legally recognized in one gender but may be denied access to services for that gender. Phillipson confirmed that gender recognition certificates are respected and reminded the House that, according to the Supreme Court ruling, **single-sex services are based on biological sex**.
