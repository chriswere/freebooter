title: Monmouth Town Council approves funding for bus station improvements
---
Monmouth Town Council has agreed to contribute to the [development of the town’s bus station](https://moderngov.microshadeapplications.co.uk/MonmouthTC/documents/s6352/Bus%20Station.pdf). The project follows the plans outlined in the **Placemaking Plan Consultation** and has been identified as a priority by both residents and the Placemaking Steering Group.  

Cllr Hoggins updated the Council on discussions with **Monmouthshire County Council (MCC)**, who will lead the project and are confident they can secure most of the funding. MCC requested a contribution from the Town Council to help support the improvements.  

Members considered the scope of the project, including whether it would provide meaningful improvements and whether it could include a **zebra crossing near Home Bargains**.  

The Council resolved to approve a contribution of up to **£80,000** from **EMR 366 PM Activities**. This funding will support the bus station development, **subject to the Town Council being satisfied with the final design**.

Councillors also discussed several broader public transport issues raised by residents or based on their own experiences, including:

1. Lack of connectivity to other public transport hubs such as train stations.  
2. Lack of connectivity to key facilities such as hospitals.  
3. Incorrect information being displayed either online or at bus stops.  
4. The reintroduction of a double-decker bus from Hereford to Monmouth that is often empty and not suitable for the roads it uses.  

To address these concerns, the Council resolved to arrange an **Extraordinary Full Council meeting** on public transport in Monmouth and to invite the relevant **Cabinet Member and MCC Officers** to attend.
