title: Monmouth Town Council approves funding for bus station improvements
---
Monmouth Town Council has agreed to contribute to the [development of the town’s bus station](https://moderngov.microshadeapplications.co.uk/MonmouthTC/documents/s6352/Bus%20Station.pdf). The project follows the plans outlined in the **Placemaking Plan Consultation** and has been identified as a priority by both residents and the Placemaking Steering Group.  

Cllr Hoggins updated the Council on discussions with **Monmouthshire County Council (MCC)**, who will lead the project and are confident they can secure most of the funding. MCC requested a contribution from the Town Council to help support the improvements.  

Members considered the scope of the project, including whether it would provide meaningful improvements and whether it could include a **zebra crossing near Home Bargains**.  

The Council resolved to approve a contribution of up to **£80,000** from **EMR 366 PM Activities**. This funding will support the bus station development, **subject to the Town Council being satisfied with the final design**.
