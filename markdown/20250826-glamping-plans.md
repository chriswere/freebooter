Monmouthshire County Council has refused a planning application to convert paddock land at Swallows Nest, Ty’r Pwll, Parc Llettis Road, Hardwick, Abergavenny, into a glamping site. The decision follows a Planning Committee meeting on 1 July 2025, where councillors rejected the officer recommendation for approval and voted unanimously to refuse the application.

## The application

The planning application (Ref: **DM/2022/01511**) was submitted by Elizabeth Pengelly and proposed:

- **Change of use** of residential paddock to tourism use.
- **Glamping accommodation**: 4 shepherd huts and 4 bell tents.
- **Ancillary structures**: a timber washroom facility and a multipurpose animal shelter.
- **New gated access and car parking** for visitors.

### Accommodation details

- Shepherd huts: 7.4m x 2.58m, curved metal roofs, max height 3.5m, two “luxury” huts with en-suite toilets, two eco versions relying on compost toilet.  
- Bell tents: 5m diameter, max height 3m, relying on compost toilet within washroom.  
- Washroom: moveable timber construction with compost toilet, shower, sink, and communal fridge/freezer (6m x 2.4m).  
- Animal shelter: 27m², flat roof 2.5–2.8m high, currently housing alpacas.  
- Car park: permeable hardstanding for 12 vehicles with native hedgerow screening.

## Site context

- The site is a **sloping paddock** adjacent to a dwelling in Hardwick, descending 8 metres over 140 metres toward the B4598.  
- Located within the **Nutrient Sensitive Catchment Area** of the River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC).  
- Surrounding area: small fields, hedgerows, and scattered residential dwellings.  
- Access: via narrow rural C24.15 lane connecting to B4598.  

## Public consultation and objections

**Fifteen local residents** and **Gobion Fawr Community Council** objected to the application. Key concerns included:

### Residential amenity

- Potential **noise, light, and activity disturbance** from glamping units, hot tubs, and car park.  
- Loss of **privacy** for neighbouring properties, particularly Amberleigh House.  
- Concerns about **litter, anti-social behaviour**, and general disruption.

### Visual impact

- Development would **urbanize open countryside**, reducing rural character and visual amenity.  
- New car park, huts, and bell tents seen as **unsightly and incompatible** with existing landscape.  

### Traffic and access

- Increased **vehicular traffic** along a narrow lane, raising **safety and inconvenience** concerns.  
- Concerns over access width, visibility splays, and proximity to private properties.

### Biodiversity and environment

- Hedge and habitat loss along proposed access.  
- Risk to local **wildlife**, including bats, birds, and hedgehogs.  
- Foul drainage and runoff into the **River Usk SAC** raised environmental concerns.

### Other concerns

- Potential **health and safety risks** for livestock.  
- Questioned **demand for tourism** in the area.  
- Disagreement over the temporary nature of washroom and glamping structures.

## Officer assessment

Despite objections, officers initially recommended **approval** based on detailed planning evaluation.

### 1. Principle of development

- Policy **S11 – Visitor Economy** encourages sustainable tourism.  
- Policy **T2** limits permanent accommodation outside settlements but allows exceptions for sustainable tourism.  
- Officers concluded that the proposal constituted **sustainable, low-impact tourism**, with potential benefits for local economy.

### 2. Design and landscape impact

- Shepherd huts and bell tents designed to **blend with rural landscape**.  
- Additional **landscaping and hedgerow planting** proposed to screen car park and maintain visual amenity.  
- Structures are largely **movable and temporary**, reducing long-term landscape impact.

### 3. Impact on residential amenity

- Distance of at least **35m** from nearest dwelling.  
- Proposed hedgerows would **screen views** of car park and units.  
- Maximum occupancy limited to **28 people**, controlled via planning condition.  
- Officers noted seasonal use and small scale made **significant disturbance unlikely**.

### 4. Transport

- **New gated access** proposed with visibility splays of 2.4m x 22m.  
- Car park for 12 vehicles, surfaced with Ecogrid to retain green appearance.  
- MCC Highways raised **no objection**, subject to Section 184 agreement.  
- Traffic increases considered **minor and outside peak hours**.

### 5. Biodiversity

- Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey identified **species-poor grassland, hedgerows, and small buildings**.  
- Precautionary measures proposed for bats, reptiles, hedgehogs, and breeding birds.  
- Additional **hedgerow, tree, and wildflower meadow planting** included to provide net biodiversity gain.  
- Lighting plan required to prevent **light spill affecting nocturnal species**.

### 6. Green infrastructure

- New planting and habitat enhancements designed to **increase biodiversity** and mitigate loss of hedgerow.  
- Long-term **landscape management plan** recommended.

### 7. Foul drainage

- Two shepherd huts served by existing septic tank.  
- Remaining units served by **compost toilet system**.  
- NRW and MCC Biodiversity Officer satisfied **no increase in phosphate** entering River Usk SAC.

## Planning committee decision

At the **1 July 2025 Planning Committee**, councillors debated the application and voted to refuse it.

### Reasons for refusal

1. **Noise and Disturbance**: Scale and layout of glamping units and car park would cause unacceptable noise for residents, contrary to **DES1** and **EP1**.

### Vote outcome

- **For refusal**: 12  
- **Against refusal**: 0  
- **Abstentions**: 2  

The motion was carried, and the application was formally refused.
