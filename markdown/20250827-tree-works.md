title: Monmouthshire tree works approved across the county
---

Monmouthshire County Council has approved a range of tree maintenance and removal applications, covering properties from Abergavenny to Chepstow. The decisions, all finalised on 26 August, reflect ongoing efforts to manage tree health, safety, and property access across the county.

In Abergavenny, five trees at 15 Wedgwood Gardens will undergo maintenance. Two ash trees suffering from ash dieback will be reduced to monoliths to allow regeneration, while two further ash trees leaning over Hillside Road will have overhanging branches removed and crowns thinned to address safety concerns. A sweet chestnut at the property will also have branches removed where they overhang the road.

In Caldicot, the council approved the removal of a conifer at 45 Church Road, while at 34 Woodside, Llanbadoc, a leylandi and a conifer on the driveway side of the property are also set to be removed.

At Silver How, Llanhennock, more extensive works were approved across a number of trees, including crown reductions on silver birch and oak trees, removal of deadwood from beech trees, and the felling of a dead beech, an ash, and an elm tree. These works aim to ensure the safety and long-term health of the gardenâ€™s tree collection.

In Chepstow, two mature walnut trees at Crossways Farm, alongside Wintour Close, will undergo crown thinning of up to 20% and crown lifting to remove lower limbs overhanging the pavement and driveway.

At Bushes Farm, Chapel Road, Earlswood, Shirenewton, the council approved the discharge of Condition 8 linked to a previous planning decision, allowing tree-related works on the site to proceed in line with the approved plans.

Other approved works include reduction and shaping of cherry and hawthorn trees at Applecross Cottage, Mathern, felling of a Magnolia tree at Masonic Hall, Monmouth, and a 30% crown reduction to a Sycamore tree at 9 Company Farm Drive, Llanfoist.
