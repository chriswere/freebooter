title: New walking routes connect the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean to Britain’s national network  
---

A growing national project is opening up new opportunities for walkers in the **Wye Valley and Forest of Dean**.  

[Slow Ways](https://slowways.org), a not-for-profit, citizen-led initiative, is building a walking network that connects every town, city, and national landscape in Britain. The idea is simple: if people know there’s a safe and clear way to walk somewhere, they’re more likely to do it.  

Started in 2020 by geographer **Dan Raven-Ellison**, Slow Ways has grown with the help of thousands of volunteers. Together they have created nearly **10,000 routes** linking over **2,500 places**. Many of these walks pass through or connect to our area – from the **market towns of the Forest of Dean** to the villages and riverside paths of the **Wye Valley**.  

The Slow Ways routes are designed to:  

- Be safe, direct, and accessible  
- Avoid busy roads where possible  
- Include resting places every 5–10 km  
- Pass through public transport hubs  
- Be enjoyable and easy to follow  

Not every path is suitable for everyone, but routes are tested by walkers and wheelchair/scooter users. Reviews, star ratings, and surveys help highlight surface quality, gradients, and obstacles like stiles or mud. Routes with three or more positive reviews become “verified” – tried and tested by the community.  

Slow Ways is about more than just hiking. It encourages people to walk or wheel for everyday journeys, like visiting friends, shopping, or commuting, as well as for longer adventures.  

You can explore the routes through the **Slow Ways website**, their iOS and Android apps, or printed maps and atlases. Each walk comes with practical advice and friendly tips from other walkers to help you on your way.  

Slow Ways is powered by citizens, not governments – although the team hopes local and national authorities will support and invest in the future of walking.  

Their long-term vision is for:  

- **Everyone** – safe and inclusive routes for all abilities  
- **Everywhere** – a walking network as simple to use as the road system  
- **Every day** – walking and wheeling as natural parts of daily life  
- **Every time** – reliable paths, with data to give confidence before setting out  

If you’d like to explore or contribute to this growing network, visit [slowways.org](https://slowways.org).  

You can also share your own experiences, review routes, and help verify paths in the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean. Every contribution makes a difference – strengthening a network that connects people to nature, to each other, and to the wider world.
