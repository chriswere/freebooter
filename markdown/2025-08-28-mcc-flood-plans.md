title: Public asked for views on Monmouthshire’s flood risk plans
---

Monmouthshire County Council is asking residents to share their views on how the county manages flood risk. A public consultation is now open on the council’s draft **Local Flood Risk Management Strategy**, which sets out plans for the next six years.

The consultation runs from **Friday 1 August until Friday 26 September, 2025**.

## What’s the consultation about?

The draft strategy explains how the council plans to deal with flooding from surface water, groundwater and smaller local rivers and streams. It builds on the county’s first flood strategy from 2013 and takes into account lessons from recent major floods, new legislation and national policy changes.

Residents are being asked to give feedback on the proposals, either online or by filling in a paper survey available from their nearest Community Hub. The council says local experiences are vital to shaping its plans.

## Drop-in events

People can also speak to officers in person at drop-in sessions across the county:

- **Abergavenny Community Hub** – Wednesday 20 August, 9am–5pm  
- **Monmouth Community Hub** – Tuesday 26 August, 9am–5pm  
- **Usk Community Hub** – Thursday 28 August, 9am–5pm  
- **Chepstow, Manor Way** – Wednesday 10 September, 9am–5pm  
- **Caldicot Community Hub** – Thursday 11 September, 9am–5pm  

## What happens next?

Once the consultation closes, the council will review the feedback and update the strategy. The final version will go to the Cabinet for approval before being sent to the Welsh Government. The council expects to publish an update later in **late 2025 or early 2026**.

Anyone with questions can email **flooding@monmouthshire.gov.uk**.  

*The consultation is also available in Welsh on the council’s website.*
