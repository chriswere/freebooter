title: Senedd debate highlights future of Caerphilly’s libraries
---

A debate in the Senedd (16 September 2025) has put the spotlight on the future of library services in Caerphilly, where council plans to close **10 libraries** remain uncertain.  

During the session, [Ms Delyth Jewell MS](https://senedd.wales/people/5207) (Plaid Cymru, South Wales East) raised concerns after a **judge granted an interim injunction**, requiring the libraries to stay open until an ongoing legal challenge is settled.  

Ms Jewell said the situation had created major uncertainty for staff and residents. She told the Senedd: "In Caerphilly, council plans to close 10 libraries are thankfully now on hold, but we don't know for how long... Not all libraries have reopened, because the council had pushed ahead with closing them at the end of August. Some staff have left because of the uncertainty."  

She pointed to Nelson library as one example, where reopening has been delayed, and asked what support the Welsh Government could give local authorities to help **community groups take over library services** if closures went ahead.  

Responding, [Ms Jane Hutt MS](https://senedd.wales/people/156) (Welsh Labour, Vale of Glamorgan), Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, said she could not comment on the legal case but joined Ms Jewell in stressing the **“vital importance of our library services in our communities.”**  

Ms Hutt noted that across Wales, community groups and councils already play a role in sustaining libraries. She said the Government would consider **sharing expertise and guidance** with residents in Caerphilly, highlighting successful examples from other parts of Wales.  

The row over Caerphilly’s libraries has been ongoing since the council first announced its closure plans earlier in 2025. Campaigners argue the services are essential for children, education, and community life.
