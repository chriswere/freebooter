title: Forest MP hits out at court backlogs and calls for reform
---

Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop laid out a warning in a commons debate (9 July 2025), warning that tackling the growing Crown Court backlog requires more than simply adding sitting days—it needs fundamental reform.

“With the Crown Court backlog that we inherited at such high levels, and continuing to rise, does the Minister agree that tackling it means not just adding more sitting days but making fundamental reform?” Bishop asked.

The Minister of State for Justice, Sarah Sackman, agreed the situation is intolerable. She described record backlogs in the criminal courts as having a serious human impact on victims, witnesses, and court staff, and said radical structural reform is needed alongside increased sitting days. Sackman cited the forthcoming work of Sir Brian Leveson and the Ministry’s £450 million investment in courts as part of efforts to restore confidence in the system.

Other MPs also spoke during the debate. Conservative Ashley Fox warned that increasing early guilty plea discounts to 40% could undermine trust in the system, and questioned proposals for an “intermediate court” aimed at speeding up cases. Sackman said the courts’ priority is delivering swift justice, not cost-saving.

Emily Thornberry, drawing on 20 years’ experience as a barrister, said delays in Crown courts have led some defendants to plead “not guilty” knowing their case would take years to reach trial. Sackman responded that reform will consider new technologies and efficiencies while maintaining the integrity of jury trials.

Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds shared his personal experience as a juror, highlighting that jurors are often underused. Sackman said the issue is overall system capacity—judges, lawyers, courtrooms, and resources—not the jury system itself.

Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell and Uma Kumaran, stressed the importance of restoring public confidence, particularly for victims of crime. Kumaran highlighted that under the previous Conservative government, 60% of rape victims withdrew their cases due to delays. Sackman emphasised that victims must see timely justice, and investment in victims’ services is a key part of reforms.

Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts warned that removing jury rights for sentences under two years in an intermediate court would not address years of underfunding and staff shortages in magistrates courts. Sackman said the government aims for whole-system reform, respecting the local role of magistrates courts while tackling the backlog across the criminal justice system.

Other MPs, including Christopher Vince, noted the effects of previous court closures on victims’ confidence, echoing calls for fundamental reform. Sackman reiterated that the government is committed to restoring the system, ensuring that victims receive timely justice, and addressing the backlog comprehensively.
