title: Abergavenny restaurant sign dispute sparks heritage row 
---

A retrospective bid to keep two illuminated fascia signs at a popular Abergavenny restaurant has divided opinion — with planning officers recommending refusal but councillors voting to defer a final decision.

The application, lodged by Mr Peter Woolley for **Il Gusto** at **43 Frogmore Street**, sought to retain two internally illuminated signs already installed on the shopfront. The site lies in the **Abergavenny Conservation Area**, within the town’s historic core and close to several listed buildings, including the Baptist Church and the War Memorial.

The planning meeting where this was decided can be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=EBiA2bO-4m65F3Xq&t=5329).

## The Proposal 

The two fascia signs, each around 3 metres wide and 0.6 metres high, feature **white text on a black PVC background**. They are static, internally lit, with a brightness of **300 cd/m²**, and sit above the restaurant frontage at a height of 2.65 metres.

The application is **retrospective**, as the signs have already been fitted without formal consent. Earlier permissions for the site (2015) had allowed only **externally illuminated signage**.

## Support for the signs 

The application has received **12 neighbour comments**, all supportive. Local residents and customers described the signs as *“tasteful”*, *“elegant”*, and *“in keeping with the town’s character”*.

Supporters argued the signs:

- Help small businesses stand out in the evening economy
- Contribute to a vibrant town centre
- Are no brighter than existing signage, including Tesco opposite
- Compare favourably to other national chains that have been granted internally lit signs in Abergavenny

Abergavenny Town Council and the Abergavenny & District Civic Society also backed the application, stressing the need for **consistency** and updated guidance for shopfronts in conservation areas.

Local councillor Laura Wright also weighed in, calling the signage *“not problematic within the conservation area”*. She said illumination levels were modest, switched off at 10pm, and no different to signage that had been in place at the site for years. *“Supporting local businesses in our town centre is vital,”* she added.

## Heritage and officer concerns 

Despite this, **Monmouthshire County Council’s heritage officers** strongly opposed the scheme. They argued that:

- Internally illuminated PVC signage is **modern and out of keeping** with the Conservation Area.
- Conservation policy favours **matt finishes and traditional materials** like timber.
- The shiny finish and internal lighting make the signs *“starkly modern”* and intrusive against nearby historic shopfronts.

They suggested a compromise: disconnecting the internal lights and replacing the glossy fascia with a **matt wrap and external downlighting**.

Planning officers echoed these concerns, citing **Local Development Plan policies DES3 and HE3**, which require signage in conservation areas to preserve character. They concluded the signs had a **“detrimental impact”** on the appearance of the historic core, particularly when lit at night.

## The committee debate 

At committee, officers recommended refusal. But councillors were split. Some argued the rules were being applied too harshly to an independent business, particularly given the presence of other illuminated signage nearby.

When put to the vote, the motion to refuse failed — **5 in favour, 9 against**.

Instead, members resolved to **defer** the decision. Officers were asked to negotiate with the applicant’s agent to find a compromise, likely involving adjustments to the finish or lighting method, before bringing the case back with a **recommendation for approval with conditions**.

## What happens next 

The fate of Il Gusto’s signs now hangs in the balance. The restaurant can continue trading with the current signage in place while discussions continue. 

If a compromise is agreed, councillors are expected to approve the signs at a future meeting, bringing an end to a row that has highlighted the **tension between conservation rules and the needs of modern businesses** in Abergavenny’s town centre.
