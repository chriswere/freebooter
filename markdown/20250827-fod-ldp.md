title: Council urges residents to have their say on Forest local plan
---

The Forest of Dean District Council has launched the next stage of its **Local Plan**, inviting residents and businesses to take part in a public consultation. The consultation runs from **31 July to 11 September 2025**.

Following a Full Council meeting on **Thursday 24 July 2025**, councillors agreed to move forward with the plan, which will help shape housing, jobs, services, and the environment in the Forest of Dean over the next 20 years.

The new plan aims to:

- Address **climate change** and protect the natural environment.  
- Provide a range of **facilities, employment, and services**.  
- Support a **strong and sustainable local economy**.  
- Improve **residents’ wellbeing**.  

The plan must also meet new **government housing targets**, with over **13,000 homes needed** across the district by 2043—an increase of around **6,000 homes**. The consultation presents **different options** and allows residents to share their views on which options are most suitable for the Forest of Dean.
