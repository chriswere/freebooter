title: Bungalow approved for rear of Park Close property after controversial debate
---

A controversial plan to build a bungalow in the back garden of a Park Close home has been given the green light by Monmouthshire County Council, following months of debate and several amendments to the scheme.

The planning meeting can be view on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/XpDYGvZdEsc?si=oO8eAeFOOeW7ipjL&t=262).

The application sought permission to construct a single-storey property with its own parking and turning space behind 11 Park Close in Abergavenny.

The scheme was first brought before councillors in January, when it faced strong opposition over the narrow three-metre access lane, which fell short of Welsh planning standards. A tied vote in February left the decision hanging, but the applicant later submitted revised plans with improved parking and manoeuvring space, as well as details on drainage and biodiversity measures.

Abergavenny Town Council maintained its objection, raising issues around drainage, biodiversity, and potential access disputes between neighbours. Several local residents also criticised the plan, warning of loss of green space, privacy concerns, and overdevelopment of the area.

Despite these objections, county highways officers withdrew their earlier concerns, concluding that the updated design provided safe access and sufficient parking. Biodiversity officers accepted new measures, including bird boxes, hedgehog-friendly fencing, and landscaping, while flood and drainage specialists confirmed that surface water could be managed through a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS). Archaeologists also noted that the site sits in a sensitive area, requiring mitigation work during construction.

Planning officers recommended approval, highlighting that the bungalow’s design was modest, single-storey, and in keeping with the area, with minimal impact on neighbouring homes. Councillors agreed, granting permission subject to strict conditions — including removal of permitted development rights, landscaping requirements, and a financial contribution towards affordable housing.
