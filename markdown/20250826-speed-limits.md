title: Monmouthshire Council approves major speed limit changes across county
---
Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide-ranging set of Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) designed to improve road safety, clarify existing speed limits, and ensure that local speed limits comply with national regulations. The decisions were made during the Individual Cabinet Member Decision meeting on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00 pm.

The Cabinet Member for Climate Change and the Environment confirmed that a public inquiry would **not** be held, and that the proposed orders would proceed as planned. Two proposals on the B4293, Mitchell Troy, were not approved due to technical errors and will be reviewed in the future.

## Approved Speed Limit Changes

The Council approved the following speed limit changes across the county:

- **Redbrook Road, A466, Monmouth:** A **30mph speed limit** to correct a historical administrative omission. This section was intended to operate at 30mph but was never formally included in the legal Traffic Regulation Orders. 
- **A472, The Rhadyr, Usk:** **40mph and 30mph limits** to improve safety around the industrial BAE Systems site and the nearby equine college, where slow-moving vehicles and pedestrian traffic create higher risk. 
- **B4233, The Hendre:** **30mph limit** to match the residential character of the area and current national speed limit policy. 
- **B4233/B4347 Junction, Rockfield:** **20mph limit** in a residential area with high pedestrian activity and a complex junction layout. 
- **B4233, Monmouth to Rockfield:** **40mph limit** to create a gradual speed transition between 20mph zones, reducing sudden changes in speed that could pose risks. 
- **Mitchell Troy Road, Raglan:** **40mph limit** to improve safety in a residential area with bends, visibility issues, and multiple property access points. 
- **Staunton Road, A4136:** **40mph limit** in response to a collision cluster, including one fatality between 2020 and 2023. 
- **B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd Bach:** **40mph limit** extended across severe bends to address a documented collision cluster with ten recorded incidents between 2020 and 2023. 
- **B4596, Llancayo:** **30mph buffer zones** to provide a smoother speed transition from 50mph roads to 20mph restricted areas. 
- **Common Road, Mitchell Troy:** **20mph limit** formalised to correct an administrative oversight and ensure legal enforceability. 
- **Conway Drive, Chepstow:** **40mph limit** replaces a short national speed limit section, creating a consistent speed transition into the 20mph residential area. 
- **A466, Llandogo:** Existing **20mph limit revoked** to remove a redundant order; the road remains 20mph under default regulations. 
- **Lane from B4293 to Park House, Itton Common:** **20mph limit** formalised to match existing signage and practice. 
- **Crick Road, Portskewett:** **20mph limit** extended to cover new pedestrian infrastructure linked to a housing development. 
- **B4235, Gwernesney:** **30mph and 40mph limits** to improve safety in the residential area and provide a graduated transition from national speed limits. 
- **A466, Tintern:** **20mph limit** formalised to ensure compliance where sections lacked statutory backing despite being signed as 20mph. 

## Speed limit orders not approved

The Council decided **not** to proceed with the following proposals on the B4293, Mitchell Troy: 

- 40mph speed limit 
- 50mph speed limit 

These proposals contained errors in the technical drawings, and the Council plans to review these sections in a future consultation.

## Why the changes were made

The Council explained that the changes were needed to: 

- Address safety concerns, including areas with documented collisions and high pedestrian activity. 
- Correct administrative and legal inconsistencies in previous Traffic Regulation Orders. 
- Align local speed limits with national policy, including the 20mph default for restricted roads in Wales. 
- Provide clear and enforceable speed limits to reduce confusion for drivers. 
- Promote safer, more sustainable travel options such as walking and cycling. 

For example: 

- **Redbrook Road, Monmouth:** A 30mph limit formalises the existing arrangement for legal certainty. 
- **A472, Usk:** 40mph and 30mph limits respond to slow-moving industrial and equine traffic. 
- **Staunton Road, A4136 & B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd Bach:** New limits are based on collision data to reduce risk. 
- **Buffer zones (B4596, Llancayo) and residential areas (Rockfield, The Hendre, Gwernesney):** Smoother transitions and lower speeds protect vulnerable road users. 

## Impact on communities

The Council highlighted that these changes will: 

- Improve safety for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. 
- Encourage active and sustainable travel by making walking and cycling safer. 
- Provide legally enforceable speed limits across the county. 
- Support social justice, safeguarding, and community cohesion in line with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. 

## Funding and next steps

- The changes will be funded by Monmouthshire County Councilâ€™s Road Safety and Traffic Management budget and the Welsh Government Road Safety Grant. 
- Implementation will begin soon, with new signage and formal Traffic Regulation Orders being put in place. 
- Residents are encouraged to follow the new speed limits and continue reporting safety concerns to the Council.
