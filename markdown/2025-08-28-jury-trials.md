title: UK justice system faces urgent reforms amid backlogs and calls to protect jury trials
---

The House of Commons heard extensive debate (9 July) on the state of the UK criminal justice system, as MPs pressed the Government on backlogs, court delays, and the future of jury trials. The discussion followed the release of Sir Brian Leveson’s report, which called for once-in-a-generation reforms to improve efficiency and ensure timely justice.

Labour MPs highlighted the human cost of the backlog, noting that under the previous Conservative Government, 60% of rape victims abandoned their cases due to lengthy delays. Minister of State for Justice Sarah Sackman acknowledged the scale of the problem, emphasizing investment in victims’ services, the strengthening of the Victims’ Code, and the critical need for timely trials.

Local justice concerns were raised by Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts, who pointed to underfunding, court closures, and staff shortages affecting magistrates courts. Sackman confirmed the Government would pursue whole-system reforms rather than piecemeal changes, while noting that investments had already been made to maintain and improve court infrastructure.

Sackman defended the Government’s record on prison investment, noting that 14,000 new prison places had been committed alongside sentencing reforms and £450 million allocated to courts. She stressed that additional Crown Court sitting days—over 4,000 more than previously agreed—were part of the effort to tackle delays, but structural reform remained essential.

The debate also focused on the role of jury trials. Concerns were raised about any potential erosion of the right to a jury, with MPs warning that such changes could undermine public confidence. Sackman repeatedly reassured the House that jury trials would remain central for serious cases, while noting that Sir Brian Leveson’s recommendations emphasized proportionate reforms to ensure timely justice. She argued that the current system’s delays, not trial format, posed the greatest threat to both victims and defendants.

Questions were also raised about plea bargaining, with opposition MPs urging the Government to rule out reducing sentences by up to 40% for guilty pleas—a practice common in the United States. Sackman confirmed the Government had no intention of replicating the US system and emphasized careful policy development to balance swifter justice with public protection.

Some MPs suggested adopting practices from other jurisdictions, including intensive supervision courts and faster hearings for domestic abuse cases. Sackman said the Government would consider lessons from abroad, alongside preventive interventions and rehabilitation programs, to reduce reoffending and relieve court backlogs.

The debate underscored a shared recognition across parties that the UK criminal justice system is at a critical juncture. Sackman stressed that reform, investment, and engagement with legal professionals would be central to addressing backlogs, protecting victims, and maintaining public confidence in both jury trials and the wider judicial process.
