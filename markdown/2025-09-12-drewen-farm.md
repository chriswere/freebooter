---

Monmouthshire County Council’s Planning Committee has approved a major new residential development at Drewen Farm, completing the housing allocation for the strategic Wonastow Road site. The decision follows careful consideration of environmental, transport, and community impacts, and approval comes with a series of conditions and planning obligations to ensure the development meets local needs and protects the surrounding environment.

## The proposed development

The Drewen Farm development will see **110 new homes** constructed on the final part of the strategic Wonastow Road site, as allocated in the Monmouthshire Local Development Plan (LDP). The scheme includes a mix of housing types and tenures, designed to provide:

- **Affordable housing:** 35% of all homes (39 units) will be affordable, primarily social rent. The mix includes:
  - 2-person, 1-bedroom flats: 62%
  - 4-person, 2-bedroom houses: 23%
  - 5-person, 3-bedroom houses: 10%
  - 7-person, 4-bedroom houses: 3%

- **Public open space and play areas:** An off-site contribution of approximately £58,000 will fund fixed play facilities at Rockfield Park or Drybridge Park, accessible via active travel links.

- **Biodiversity enhancements:** A sum of £40,000–£45,000 will support the protection and restoration of the SINC (Site of Importance for Nature Conservation) on the site, including ongoing maintenance.

- **Sustainable transport improvements:** £255,000 will be invested in walking, cycling, and bus services, including new active travel routes linking the development to Monmouth town centre.

- **Education contribution:** £439,652 to support local schools for the anticipated 23 additional pupils from the development.

The development will also include new pedestrian and cycle paths, landscaped open spaces, and sustainable drainage systems, with a focus on protecting and enhancing local trees, woodland, and hedgerows.

## Addressing community concerns

During the planning process, residents and the Town Council raised questions about traffic, drainage, and environmental impacts:

- **Access:** Primary access will be via the existing Kingswood Gate development. Watery Lane will be retained solely for pedestrian, cycling, and emergency vehicle access; no regular vehicle traffic will use this route.

- **Construction management:** A Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) will be required before work begins to ensure construction traffic uses approved routes, with measures to control dust, noise, and other nuisances.

- **Noise:** A detailed noise assessment will be undertaken to assess the impact of nearby industrial activity, with mitigation measures implemented where needed.

- **Drainage and flood risk:** The site is mostly in Flood Zone 1. Low-lying areas will be managed with cut-off ditches and detention basins. The final drainage scheme will require approval under the Sustainable Drainage Approval Body (SAB) process.

- **Heritage and ecology:** Archaeological mitigation measures and species protection plans, including a dormouse strategy, will be implemented. A Green Infrastructure Management Plan will ensure ongoing care for the site’s natural features.

## Planning obligations and conditions

To support sustainable development, the Council has set out detailed conditions and obligations, including:

- **Affordable housing provision**
- **Off-site contributions for play, biodiversity, transport, PROW, and education**
- **S278 agreements** for access and road improvements
- **Comprehensive landscaping and green infrastructure plans**
- **Flood protection, drainage, and pollution prevention measures**
- **Monitoring and maintenance of ecological and landscape features**

In total, the planning conditions cover **22 areas**, ensuring the development is safe, sustainable, and sensitive to local surroundings.

## What happens next?

With planning approval granted, the developer can now proceed to the **reserved matters stage**, where detailed designs for the layout, appearance, landscaping, and scale of the homes will be submitted for final approval. Construction will follow, guided by the approved management and environmental plans to minimize disruption and protect local amenities.

Residents can expect the first stages of work to focus on site preparation, sustainable drainage installation, and landscape protection, with ongoing monitoring to ensure the site is developed in line with planning conditions.
