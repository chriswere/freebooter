title: New councillor, road concerns, and village updates in Raglan
---

**Raglan, 25 June 2025** – Raglan Community Council held its ordinary meeting at the Fellowship Centre on Wednesday evening, welcoming new councillor Luke Thompson and discussing a range of local issues from road safety to dog waste bins.  

## Welcome to a new councillor  
Luke Thompson officially joined the council, signing his declaration of office. Chair Cllr Nick Ramsay welcomed him to the team, promising a smooth start as he settles into his new role.  

## Residents speak up  
A local resident raised concerns about the Chepstow Road to Llandenny junction. The council confirmed it has already contacted Monmouthshire Highways, and the Clerk will follow up to find out when the planned safety improvements are expected.  

## Planning concerns continue  
Council members discussed ongoing frustrations with planning officers who have not responded to previous correspondence. The council has now decided to make a formal complaint about the lack of communication.  

A separate planning issue on land adjacent to High Street, Raglan, also caught the council’s attention. The proposed development of three houses was flagged as a potential traffic risk on the A40 trunk road. The council will formally object and request a decision timeline from the planning department.  

## Dog walk and allotment updates  
The popular Dog Walk area needs urgent attention. Overgrown grass, damaged footpaths, and dead trees are affecting the site. The council will take matters into its own hands, arranging maintenance, clearing debris, and upgrading footpaths.  

Allotments also remain a priority. Some plots have been neglected, and the council will remind tenants of their responsibilities and consider reallocating plots where necessary.  

## Waste and cleanliness  
Dog waste bins purchased by the council will soon be installed by Monmouthshire County Council, following communication with both the contractor and council officers.  

## Community support and events  
The council approved several grants, including contributions to the Raglan Festival, St Cadoc Church, and the Baptist Church. Members also discussed the Community Award Scheme and plan to meet with the Baptist Church and Minister to set clear guidelines for future awards.  

## Village life updates  
Cllr Penny Jones raised two important village matters: bus timetable accessibility and Christmas decorations. Residents have reported that digital bus timetables are difficult to read, so paper copies will also be installed. Plans for festive lighting are also underway, with council representatives following up with county officers to ensure decorations return in 2025.  

## Other business  
The council approved the internal audit for the year ending March 2025 and agreed to submit it to Audit Wales. Several planning applications were reviewed, with most receiving no objections, while one application has been withdrawn and will be resubmitted.  

The meeting closed at 8:14 pm, with the next session scheduled for 23 July 2025.
