title: Herefordshire Council announces September road closures for resurfacing
---

Herefordshire Council has confirmed a series of temporary road closures across the county this September as part of a resurfacing programme.

The works will begin on **1 September 2025**. Each closure is required for safety reasons while works are carried out. Diversion routes will be signposted locally and published online at [One.Network](https://one.network).

Although the legal order allows closures for up to **18 months**, the programme is expected to last **around one month**, with each road closed only for the duration needed. Exact dates and times will be shown on advanced warning signs placed on-site.
