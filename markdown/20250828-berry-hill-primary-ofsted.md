title: Berry Hill Primary celebrates "good" Ofsted report
---

Berry Hill Primary School in Coleford is celebrating after inspectors rated the school **“Good”** in all areas following their visit on **3rd and 4th June 2025**.  

The report marks a big step forward for the school, which was judged as *“Requires Improvement”* at its last inspection in January 2023.

## Strong values and positive atmosphere

Inspectors praised the school’s ethos, built around the **“3 Bs: be kind, be respectful, be your best.”**  
They found that pupils feel safe, happy, and eager to learn. Children treat each other with kindness and respect, and enjoy taking on responsibilities such as being house captains or members of the pupil parliament.  

The report also highlighted pupils’ **tolerance and compassion**, noting that they understand discrimination is wrong and support classmates who need extra help.

## What the school does well

- **Curriculum:** Teachers have designed lessons that reflect Berry Hill’s local context while also broadening pupils’ horizons. The curriculum is especially well thought out for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).  
- **Reading:** Children begin learning phonics as soon as they join Reception. Most are fluent readers by the end of Year 2. Those with speech and language difficulties are well supported to catch up.  
- **Maths:** Results in 2024 were below average, but a new approach has now strengthened pupils’ understanding. Inspectors saw both younger and older children making good progress.  
- **SEND Support:** Staff now identify pupils’ needs much earlier and adapt lessons well. As a result, pupils with SEND achieve strongly.  
- **Personal Development:** Pupils are encouraged to become reflective, confident, and socially responsible.  
- **Leadership:** Headteacher **Amy Pugh** and her team were praised for their clear and ambitious vision, which staff consistently follow. Governors, led by **Tracey Johnson**, were said to have an accurate view of the school’s strengths and areas for growth.  

## Areas to improve

Inspectors also noted areas where the school still needs to improve:  

1. **Deeper Learning:** Sometimes pupils are not challenged enough to extend their knowledge.  
2. **Writing:** Handwriting, spelling, and punctuation are not taught consistently well, meaning some pupils keep repeating errors.  
3. **Early Years:** In Reception, children do not always get enough chances to apply skills across different areas of learning, which can affect preparation for Year 1.  

## Early years and beyond

Children in Reception get a strong start in reading, writing, and maths, though inspectors said they sometimes miss out on wider opportunities.  
Across the school, behaviour was described as good, with only occasional fussiness that is quickly managed by staff.  

## Safeguarding

Safeguarding arrangements were found to be **effective**, with inspectors confident that children’s welfare is a top priority.
