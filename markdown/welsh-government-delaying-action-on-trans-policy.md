title: Welsh government delaying action on trans policy
---

The Welsh Government has been accused of avoiding clear answers on how it plans to respond to a key **Supreme Court ruling** on the legal definition of sex, after questions were raised again in the Senedd this week.  

On **16 September 2025**, [Ms Laura Anne Jones MS](https://senedd.wales/people/4562) (Reform UK, South Wales East) pressed the Government for an update, noting that **five months** had passed since the court decision.  

She told the Senedd: "Surely enough time has now passed for you to adapt to the law and even, perhaps, establish what a woman actually is. But given the significance, I would like to once again ask for an oral statement on the floor of the Senedd on what actions the Welsh Government has taken to rectify its policies so that they now fall in line with the Supreme Court ruling."  

The ruling confirmed that, under the Equality Act, the term **“woman” must mean a biological woman**, which has implications for single-sex spaces such as refuges, hospital wards and toilets.  

Responding, **Ms Jane Hutt MS** (Welsh Labour, Vale of Glamorgan), Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, did not commit to immediate changes. Instead, she pointed to ongoing work at Westminster, saying the **Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)** had recently reported on its consultation and that the matter was now with the UK Government’s **Minister for Women and Equalities, Ms Bridget Phillipson MP**.  

Ms Hutt told Members: "That now of course rests with Westminster... in due course we will hear the outcome of their consideration."  

The exchange highlighted growing frustration from opposition Members who say the Welsh Government is **“kicking the can down the road”** instead of setting out how policies in Wales will be updated.  

Campaigners argue that with so many services affected - from women’s refuges to hospital wards - staff and service users need clarity now. Others say the issue is complex and requires careful handling.

For now, however, the Government has given no timeline for when a statement will be made in the Senedd or when Welsh policies will be reviewed.
