title: "Employment Rights Bill: Progressive parties back worker reforms"
---

The Labour Government, with support from the **Green Party, Plaid Cymru, the SNP, and several independent MPs**, is moving forward with the **Employment Rights Bill**. The Bill is expected to become law in **autumn 2025**.  

This will be the biggest change to employment law in many years. The Bill will make work fairer and give people stronger rights at work.  

## What the Bill Does
The Bill will add to and change existing laws, including the **Employment Rights Act 1996**. Most changes will take place between **2025 and 2027**.  

Some of the key changes include:  

- **Strikes and Trade Unions**  
  - Rules on “minimum service levels” for strikes will be removed.  
  - Taking part in industrial action will become automatically protected from dismissal.  
  - Ballot rules will be simplified and mandates will last 12 months instead of 6.  

- **Parental Leave**  
  - Paternity leave and parental leave will become “day one rights” in April 2026.  
  - Restrictions on taking paternity leave after shared parental leave will be removed.  

- **Sick Pay**  
  - Statutory sick pay will be paid from the first day of illness.  
  - The lower earnings limit will be removed so more workers qualify.  

- **Fair Work Agency**  
  - A new body will be set up in April 2026 to enforce rights like holiday pay and sick pay.  

- **Dismissal and Rehire**  
  - From October 2026, dismissing someone and rehiring them on worse terms will usually be automatically unfair.  

- **Harassment and NDAs**  
  - Employers will have stronger duties to prevent harassment.  
  - Clauses in contracts that try to stop workers speaking out about harassment or discrimination will be banned.  

- **Zero-Hours Contracts**  
  - From 2027, workers will have the right to request guaranteed hours.  

- **Unfair Dismissal**  
  - From 2027, protection from unfair dismissal will start on the first day of a job (instead of after 2 years).  

## Why This Matters
Labour says the Bill will “make work pay” and improve job security. The **Green Party, Plaid Cymru, the SNP, and independent MPs** have supported the plans, saying they will help protect workers after years of insecure and unfair contracts.  

Employers are being advised to prepare now, especially for the changes due in **autumn 2025** and **April 2026**.  

## Not law yet
The Bill is **not law yet**. Until it receives **Royal Assent** from the King, the current rules remain in place.
