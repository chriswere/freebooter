title: Tree felling and historic renovations given green light by council
---

Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide range of planning applications in recent weeks, covering tree maintenance, removals, property renovations, and historic building repairs. The decisions highlight the council’s ongoing efforts to balance safety, preservation, and modern living needs across the county.

## Tree works

In Abergavenny, five trees at 15 Wedgwood Gardens will undergo maintenance. Two ash trees suffering from ash dieback will be reduced to monoliths to encourage regeneration, while two further ash trees leaning over Hillside Road will have overhanging branches removed and crowns thinned to improve safety. A sweet chestnut will also have branches overhanging the road removed.

In Caldicot, approval was granted for the removal of a single conifer at 45 Church Road. Meanwhile, at 34 Woodside, Llanbadoc, a leylandi and a conifer on the driveway side of the property will be removed.

At Silver How, Llanhennock, multiple trees will undergo works including crown reductions, removal of deadwood, and felling of dead or diseased trees such as ash, elm, and beech. Several oak trees will have crown lifting and removal of excessive growth to ensure safety and improve long-term health.

In Chepstow, two mature walnut trees at Crossways Farm will have crowns thinned by up to 20% and lower limbs removed where they overhang the pavement and driveway.

Other approved tree works include shaping and reduction of cherry and hawthorn trees at Applecross Cottage, Mathern, felling of a Magnolia at Masonic Hall, Monmouth, and a 30% crown reduction of a Sycamore at 9 Company Farm Drive, Llanfoist.

At Bushes Farm, Chapel Road, Earlswood, Shirenewton, the council approved the discharge of Condition 8 linked to a previous planning decision, allowing tree-related works on the site to proceed in line with approved plans.

## Property renovations and historic building works

At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent. The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the timber cupola, a small decorative structure on top of the main roof that provides ventilation and adds architectural character to the historic house. The restoration will preserve this key architectural feature while ensuring it remains safe and functional.

In Grosmont, modifications to a previous approval at Broome Villa, Hand Road were approved. The works involve extending, improving, and remodelling the detached house and outbuildings, alongside creating a new vehicular access and parking area, modernising the property while maintaining harmony with the surrounding landscape.

At Merrig Mill, Tregagle, Trellech, a series of renovations and small-scale construction projects were approved. These include converting a single-storey stone outbuilding, formerly used as a stable, into a bedroom and shower room, constructing a new small stable attached to the ancillary barn, and renovating an existing barn within the domestic curtilage for personal residential use.

All applications were validated and decided between 26 and 27 August 2025.
