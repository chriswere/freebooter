title: Labour just gets more pathetic on Gaza
---

Labour’s foreign policy weakness was exposed, yet again, in Parliament when Green Party MP Ellie Chowns asked some pretty strightforward questions on Gaza. Had ministers secured any timeframe for Israel to ease the blockade and allow aid through? Would Israel be held accountable for the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding daily? And when would the UK publish its long-promised review of the 2030 UK–Israel Roadmap?

The answers she received from Hamish Falconer, the new Labour minister at the Foreign Office, were evasive at best. Rather than engage with her concerns, he referred back to a months-old statement by David Lammy, the former Foreign Secretary. The government had nothing new to say, despite the situation in Gaza worsening with every passing week.

This revealed the hollow centre of Labour’s approach to foreign affairs. While Ellie Chowns urges the Government to hold Israel to account for starving civilians and blocking aid, Mr Falconer chose to hand-wave the concerns away. This is not a government acting with conviction, but of a party afraid to take any kind of stand against an unfolding genocide.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is accelerating. Children are starving, hospitals are shutting down, and families are being driven from their homes. Yet the Labour government, faced with clear and direct questions, are paralysed. Their vague condemnations of Israeli actions have become a tired ritual: mealy-mouthed words in Parliament and no tangible steps to stop the suffering.

By ignoring Ms Chowns’s well-founded concerns, Labour is saying that it prefers to avoid questions rather than confront them. It is a dangerous form of cowardice, and it leaves Britain silent at a time when clarity and moral courage are needed.
