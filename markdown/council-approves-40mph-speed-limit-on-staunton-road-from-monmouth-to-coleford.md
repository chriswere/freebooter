title: Council approves 40mph speed limit on Staunton Road (from Monmouth to Coleford)
---

Monmouthshire County Council has approved a new **40mph speed limit** on Staunton Road (A4136) following a detailed engineering assessment and community consultation. The decision was part of the Individual Cabinet Member Decision meeting held on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00 pm.

The change is aimed at addressing urgent safety concerns on this strategic route, which connects Monmouth to Gloucestershire and carries a variety of vehicles, including heavy goods traffic, with limited alternative routes.

## Why the change was needed

An engineering assessment highlighted that the existing speed limit on Staunton Road is **inappropriate for the roadâ€™s geometry and traffic conditions**. Key findings include:

- A **documented collision cluster** between Wyesham and the county boundary, with **five recorded collisions between 2020 and 2023**, including one fatality.  
- The road is heavily used by a range of vehicles, some of which are large, including heavy goods vehicles, creating higher safety risks at current speeds.  
- The **poor road condition** further increases the risk of accidents, making a lower speed limit necessary for safe navigation.

The Council concluded that a 40mph limit is the safest option for this section of road and will help prevent future collisions.

## Support from local community

Monmouth Town Council has expressed support for the proposed TRO. They highlighted that Staunton Road is used by a variety of vehicles, including large vehicles, and that **slower speeds will improve safety for all road users**. The Council also noted that the road's current condition requires careful navigation, which is better managed under a lower speed limit.

## Expected benefits

The introduction of the 40mph limit on Staunton Road is expected to have several positive impacts:

- **Improved safety for all road users** by reducing the likelihood and severity of collisions.  
- **Health benefits for the community**, as fewer accidents reduce the burden on emergency services and healthcare providers.  
- **Consistency with wider road safety measures** across Monmouthshire, particularly in areas with documented collision clusters such as Staunton Road and the B4235 between Chepstow and Mynydd Bach.  
- **Better traffic management**, particularly for heavy goods vehicles using this strategic route.

Council officers noted that these changes are part of a wider programme to create a safer, more consistent speed limit framework across the county and to support sustainable travel where possible.

## Next steps

- The 40mph speed limit will be formally implemented as part of the Monmouthshire County Council Traffic Regulation, Speed Limits, and Parking Regulations Consolidation Order 2019 (Amendment Order No. 17).  
- New signage will be installed, and the TRO will be legally enforceable to ensure compliance.  
- Residents and road users are encouraged to observe the new limit and continue reporting safety concerns to the Council.
