**Full Council – Monday 14th July 2025, 7pm–9:10pm**

Lydney Town Council met on Monday 14th July, with councillors discussing highways, local developments, community assets, and plans for town improvements.  

## Key decisions and updates  

- **Highways and traffic**  
  - Cllr Howard met with the Lydney Highways Manager to discuss 2025/26 priorities. Speed surveys will be carried out in some areas, with the potential for Vehicle Activated Signs (VAS) that display number plates of speeding drivers.  
  - Traffic light safety measures were also discussed: if a car runs a red light, both sets of lights lock on red until reset.  

- **Local Development and Community Assets**  
  - Updates were given on Grove Lane development, with ecological concerns possibly affecting plans.  
  - The District Council confirmed that despite previous NHS objections, changes in law mean the council could reapply to register the Newerne Street GP Surgery as a Community Asset.  
  - The council agreed **not** to re-register Lydney & District Hospital as a Community Asset at this time.  

- **Forest gateway project**  
  - Cllr R Holmes reported on discussions with West Dean Parish Council. Objections have been raised over ecology concerns, and independent surveys of bats, dormice, flora, and fauna could cost around £17,000.  

- **Finance**  
  - Payments totalling **£34,962.98** were approved.  
  - Income and expenditure reports, earmarked reserves, and bank reconciliations were all approved.  
  - VAT payments for Quarter 1 were noted.  

- **Committee reports and community issues**  
  - Anti-social behaviour at East Marsh continues to be a problem, with reports of litter, fires, and camps.  
  - The **Neighbourhood Development Plan (NDP)** consultation closes 22nd July, with further feedback to be gathered at the Summer Community Event on 19th July. A follow-up Zoom meeting will take place on 5th August.  
  - Councillors were reminded to support the Summer Community Event, which will feature pirate shows and craft activities.  

- **Strategic planning and policies**  
  - Strategic Plan 2023–2030 was updated, with some targets moving from red to amber.  
  - Biodiversity Duty Policy was reviewed and unchanged.  
  - An **Information Technology (IT) Policy** was adopted.  
  - Budget consultation for 2026/27 will run from **16th July to 12th September 2025**.  

- **Equipment and assets**  
  - A new 5-year lease for an updated **office photocopier** was approved.  
  - A 5-year hire purchase agreement for a **Kubota F391 sit-on mower** was approved. Councillors also requested costings for fitting trackers to vehicles.  
  - The council agreed to contribute **£1,500** towards a Logic Sweeper purchased by Lydney Recreation Trust.  
  - Decisions on upgrading office IT systems and buying a new multi-use vehicle were deferred to September to allow time for further quotes and feedback.  

- **Grant applications and funding**  
  - The council’s application for outdoor fitness equipment at the Mesne was unsuccessful, so the item was withdrawn.  
  - Councillors agreed to continue pursuing the **Town Centre Improvement Fund** with FoDDC officers.  

- **Consultations**  
  - For the FoDDC Local Plan 2021–2043, councillors agreed to request an extension to the end of September and to delegate the response to the Regeneration Committee.
