title: Desktop apps I use
---

Just like *former* MP Jacob Rees-Mogg showing the world that he [doesn't have a computer in his office](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/picture-of-rees-moggs-desk-shows-he-doesnt-use-a-computer-and-nobody-is-surprised-322645), I too shall share my daily workflow. Unlike Mister Rees-Mogg, I know how to use a computer (most of the time).

All apps mentioned here are *free and open source* and most should be available in most Linux distro repositories.

## Web browser

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox): My day-to-day browser of choice, I use the ESR version which usually seems like the least enshittified version, but I'm certainly not happy with how Mozilla have been behaving.
- [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net): The browser I use to read articles from my RSS reader. It does a great job of bypassing many of the annoyances of the modern web.
- [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org): I've been trying out Qutebrowser lately. Whilst I'm quite enjoying it, the lack of *Ublock Origin level* ad-blocking, as well as the lack of a in-built password manager are two factors I'm learning to work out.

## Password manager

- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org): One of the best password managers around, it also comes with the package *keepassxc-cli* which is a command line interface for KeePassXC I've been getting used to using.

## RSS reader

- [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org): I have used many, many RSS readers over the years, and this is by far my favourite. I've hooked it in to use the text-only browser Lynx to read articles which don't publish full articles in the feed and it's a very pleasant way to catch-up on the web. For those who want a GUI RSS reader, I can recommend [NewsFlash](https://github.com/patchedsoul/news-flash). People have been recommending [Newsraft](https://codeberg.org/newsraft/newsraft) but I haven't got round to giving it a spin.

## Graphics

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org): I know many folks detest this for image editing, but it's the first one I learnt to effectively use and I've become familiar with it. Whilst it may not be the best FOSS has to offer, it's certainly good enough for me.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en): I use Inkscape for all my vector-based graphics. It does everything that I need to do as is an excellent piece of FOSS software.
- [Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama): simple, intuitive pixel art tool, on Itch and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama).
- [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net): Fantastic desktop publishing package. I've used this for so many project, including, leaflets, magazines, and even a billboard once.

## Video

- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org): I use the Kdenlive AppImage for all my video editing. It does everything I need and more.
- [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com): Screen recorder and livestreaming software, very feature complete.
- [SimpleScreenRecorder](http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder): Screen recorder, not as full-featured as OBS but a useful lighter recorder.
