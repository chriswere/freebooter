title: Overnight A40 closures and restrictions near Ross-on-Wye from September
---

Drivers using the A40 between Ross-on-Wye and the England/Wales border are being warned to expect **seven months of overnight closures, speed limits, and restrictions** as major repair work continues on the road.  

National Highways has confirmed a new order will take effect from **1 September 2025** to allow verge and embankment repairs along the route. The order replaces an earlier notice.  

## What drivers need to know

The measures will include:  

- **40mph speed limit** on both eastbound and westbound A40 between Ganarew and the England/Wales border.  
- **Full overnight closures** of:  
  - The westbound A40 between Whitchurch (B4164) and the England/Wales border.  
  - The eastbound A40 from the border to the unnamed road at Ganarew.  
- **Contraflow system**: eastbound traffic near the border will be diverted onto one lane of the westbound carriageway.  
- **Width restriction**: vehicles wider than **2.9 metres** will not be allowed on the A40 between Ross-on-Wye (A449 junction) and the border.  
- **No overtaking** allowed on the westbound carriageway during contraflow operation.  
- **No pedestrians or cyclists** on sections of the A40 near the border and adjacent footways.  

## When and how long

- Works began in **September 2024** and are set to continue until **March 2026**.  
- Closures will run **overnight between 8pm and 6am**.  
- Speed limits, contraflow and width restrictions will apply **24 hours a day** for the duration.  

## Diversions

- **General traffic**: signed diversion routes will use the **A40, A465 and A49**.  
- **Abnormal/wide loads** (over 2.9m): must use the **A449/M4/M5/A40** route.  
- **Cyclists**: should follow the A466 (Wye Bridge), Route 423 of the National Cycle Network, Biblins Rope Bridge and through The Doward to Ganarew.  

## Exemptions

- Emergency service vehicles, special forces, and winter maintenance vehicles are exempt from certain restrictions.
