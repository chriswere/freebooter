title: Criminal damage and theft reported at Cinderfordâ€™s Miners Welfare Skate Park
---

Cinderford Town Council has reported a rise in incidents of criminal damage at the Miners Welfare Skate Park, with police now investigating.

The North Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) confirmed they are working with the council following several recent reports, including the theft of a safety chain from a swing. This is the second time in recent weeks that a safety chain has been stolen from the park.

The missing chain presents a serious risk to users if it goes unnoticed, and the council has warned that continued vandalism could lead to certain equipment being cordoned off in the interest of public safety.

The Town Council and police have reminded residents that the skate park is a community facility, provided for public enjoyment, and should be treated with care and respect. Residents are asked to help protect and preserve the site.
