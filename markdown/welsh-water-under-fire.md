title: Welsh Water under fire as rivers, jobs, and public trust suffer
---
Welsh Water (also known as Dŵr Cymru) is once again facing sharp criticism over its performance, staffing plans, and executive pay, raising questions about whether the utility is meeting its responsibilities to the people of Wales.

At a recent Senedd session (17th September 2025), Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders highlighted that over the next 18 to 24 months, Welsh Water plans to cut up to 500 jobs, representing a 12% reduction in staff. She raised concerns that these cuts are being proposed even as the company transitions to a new chief executive, Roch Cheroux, and noted that water bills have increased by around 27%.

Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change, Huw Irranca-Davies, responded that the Welsh Government is focused on performance and engages regularly with Dŵr Cymru. He noted that investment will be made to improve water quality and flood prevention, and that voluntary redundancies and staff reallocation will be prioritized to minimize job losses. Mr Irranca-Davies added that the Welsh Government continues to assess the company’s performance and push for improvements.

Concerns over environmental impacts remain pressing. Reports indicate that raw sewage has been discharged into Welsh waterways over 100,000 times in the past year, with rivers such as the Wye, Usk, and Teifi identified as being in very poor health. Previous scrutiny from Liberal Democrat MS Jane Dodds highlighted that executives received significant bonuses during periods of poor performance and pollution incidents, raising questions about accountability.

Dŵr Cymru confirmed that its Chief Executive and Chief Finance Officer would forgo bonuses for the 2022-23 financial year. The company stated that executive remuneration is decided by an independent Remuneration Committee and is subject to oversight by its Members.

Despite these assurances, politicians continue to press for fundamental reforms, including a new independent economic regulator for Wales and a potential Welsh Water Bill, to address ongoing governance and environmental challenges.
