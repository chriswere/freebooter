title: Planning appeals dismissed for North Barn, Whitehouse Farm, Llanfair Kilgeddin
---

The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed two appeals relating to North Barn at Whitehouse Farm, Llanvair Grange Road, Llanfair Kilgeddin, Monmouthshire (NP7 9BB). The decisions were issued by JP Tudor BA (Hons), Solicitor (non-practising), acting as an Inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers.  

The appeals followed the refusal of planning permission and listed building consent by Monmouthshire County Council in January 2025.

- **Applicant:** Emma Dymond  
- **Nature of Appeal:** Listed building consent under section 100 of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023  
- **Proposal:** Same as Appeal A  
- **Application Ref:** DM/2024/01511 (dated 6 December 2024)  
- **Council Decision:** Refused 22 January 2025  
- **Site Visit:** 18 June 2025  

**Outcome:** Both appeals were **dismissed**.

## Preliminary matters

- The Council did not object to most internal alterations to create an open-plan living space.  
- A Heritage Impact Statement (HIS) noted that previous conversions in the 1990s–2000s had already altered the interior, and further minor changes would not adversely affect historic character.  
- Planning permission and listed building consent had already been granted for a similar scheme (DM/2024/01508 & DM/2024/01509), differing only in the size of the opening from the kitchen into the extension.  
- The main dispute concerned **the size of the opening in the external wall** of North Barn.

## Main issue

The Inspector identified the primary issue as whether the proposed development **preserves the special architectural and historic interest** of Whitehouse Farmhouse, a Grade II listed building.

### Context

- North Barn: former agricultural threshing barn, part of a group including South Barn and the Coach House.  
- While not individually listed, North Barn is **curtilage-listed** and enjoys the same level of statutory protection as Whitehouse Farmhouse under s76(5) of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023.  
- Legal framework: Sections 314A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Section 96 of the 2023 Act require **special regard to preserving listed buildings**.  
- Relevant policy: Planning Policy Wales (PPW, Edition 12) and Technical Advice Note 24 (TAN 24) on the historic environment.  

## Significance of the site

- **Whitehouse Farmhouse:** early 17th-century Grade II listed building with much original form and period detailing.  
- **North Barn:** rubble stone former threshing barn, possibly 18th century, converted to residential use circa 2000. Retains significance as a substantial agricultural building and part of the farmstead associated with Whitehouse Farmhouse.  

## Assessment of effects

### 1. Lean-to extension:

- Small ancillary lean-to structures are sometimes found on similar agricultural buildings.  
- Size, scale, materials (oak finish, natural slate roof), and set-back from the main barn are largely acceptable.  
- Extension is potentially reversible and already benefits from extant consent.  

### 2. Disputed kitchen opening:

- Proposed wide opening in the external wall would remove:  
  - One of two arrow slit vents  
  - A modern window from previous conversion  
- Council and Cadw identified **heritage harm**, as the opening would:  
  - Remove historic fabric  
  - Be uncharacteristic for a threshing barn  
  - Diminish evidential value of arrow slit vent  

### 3. Appellant argument:

- Removal of modern, unsympathetic window could improve overall elevation.  
- Acknowledged heritage impact but argued magnitude would be low due to prior conversions.  
- Argued new opening would be partly concealed by lean-to extension.  

### 4. Inspector’s findings:
 
- Visibility aside, **heritage harm exists due to loss of historic fabric and arrow slit vent**.  
- Wide opening is untypical for traditional threshing barns.  
- Previous alterations do not justify further harm.  
- Views and setting of Whitehouse Farmhouse would not be directly affected.  

## Other considerations

- Cadw’s representations raised broader objections, including the lean-to extension itself, but these elements already benefit from consent and were **not a deciding factor**.  
- No substantial public or community benefits arise from the proposed works. The lean-to extension could be constructed under existing consents without impacting historic fabric.  

## Conclusions

- **Harm to listed building:** Considerable weight given statutory presumption in favour of preservation.  
- **Policy conflict:** Proposal conflicts with PPW, TAN 24, and Monmouthshire LDP policies DES1 and H4 regarding the historic environment.  
- **Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015:** Decision aligns with sustainable development principles.  

**Final Decision:** Both Appeal A and Appeal B were **dismissed**.  

## Council response

- Monmouthshire County Council minutes recorded:  
  - Appeal A: Dismissed  
  - Appeal B: Dismissed  
- Planning Inspectorate report received and noted by council members.
