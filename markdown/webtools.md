title: Web tools I use
---

## Front ends

This page used to have a lot more front ends to websites such as Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, however over the years, these platforms have tightened their APIs and made it difficult to use their platforms with 3rd party tools. As a result of this, I'm trying to use *free and open source* alternatives to the big tech services.

- [Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io): Managed by friend of [Freeboosters](https://video.thepolarbear.co.uk/c/the_freebooters) [TheFrenchGhosty](https://github.com/TheFrenchGhosty) Invidious is one of the best ways to interact with YouTube. Whilst the number of instances are dwindling due to YouTube aggressive enshitification, it's still an incredible admirable project.
- [Lingva Translate](https://lingva.ml) ([project page](https://github.com/TheDavidDelta/lingva-translate)): A FOSS front-end for Google Translate.

## Web browser add-ons

- [behind!](https://github.com/kubuzetto/behind): This is a great tool for helping you download photos and videos from many websites.
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/): The best ad blocking tool out there, and the primary reason I'm still using Firefox web browser.

## Online resources

- [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com): A large collection of fonts, searchable by licence.
- [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com): A large collection of fonts, searchable by licence.
- [FreePD](http://freepd.com): A large library of public domain music. I don't use music in my videos any more, but this still remains the best place for public domain stock music.

## Closed source web apps

Whilst I avoid using non-FOSS tools whenever possible, the following are what I'll make an exception for.

- [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org): This allows you to set up a one-time-use temporary email address for signing up to online services. I use it for all accounts that I don't consider important, and for services where I don't which to leave my real email address.
