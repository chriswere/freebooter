---

Monmouth motorcyclist and social media personality [Vanessa Ruck](https://thegirlonabike.com) – widely known as The Girl on a Bike – has released her guide to what she describes as the “ultimate one-day motorcycle trip in the UK,” starting and finishing in the Wye Valley.

The route showcases some of the area’s best riding roads, including the A466 from Chepstow to Monmouth, the B4235, the A4136 towards Symonds Yat, and a return stretch along the River Wye. The ride is designed to highlight both the scenery and the wealth of local stop-offs that make the valley such a draw for visitors.

Among the suggested breaks are Monmouth’s historic high street and picnic area, the Lion Inn at Trellech, and Symonds Yat Rock with its panoramic views across the valley. Other recommended stops include Tintern Abbey, the Old Station Tintern, and Bigsweir Bridge – one of the most photographed crossings of the River Wye.

Vanessa, who has built an online following of more than 460,000 across her channels, has become known for her motorcycle adventures and honest storytelling. After a road traffic accident in 2014 left her facing seven surgeries and years of recovery, she turned to motorcycling as both a form of escapism and a way to embrace new challenges. Since then, she has ridden across the world, from Iceland to Bolivia, and now shares her passion for exploring closer to home.

Her Wye Valley loop is promoted as a one-day ride, but she also highlights how it can be extended into a weekend. Additional attractions nearby include Clearwell Caves, Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean, Goodrich Castle, and filming locations from the Netflix series Sex Education.

Accommodation suggestions along the route range from local inns such as the Lion in Trellech to guesthouses in Monmouth and Tintern, with plenty of smaller bed and breakfasts tucked away in the surrounding countryside.

With its combination of winding woodland roads, historic landmarks and riverside views, the route underlines why the Wye Valley is so often described as one of the UK’s most scenic regions – and now has the endorsement of one of Monmouth’s most recognisable adventurers.
