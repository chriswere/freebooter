title: Ellie Chowns challenges government on social housing targets
---

Green MP Ellie Chowns has pressed the Labour government to set clear targets for the delivery of new social housing. Speaking during a debate in the House of Commons on 15 September 2025, Ms Chowns asked Housing Minister Mr Matthew Pennycook why the government has refused to commit to specific numbers.

## Ms Chowns asks why no targets are being set

Ms Chowns asked:  
> "Given that the Minister feels that social housing is so important, can he explain why he will not set a target for it?"  

When Mr Pennycook avoided the direct "why," Ms Chowns followed up simply with:  
> "The question was why."

## Government says targets are under review

Mr Pennycook responded that the government had discussed the issue "many, many occasions" but was still not setting a target. He argued that long-term forecasting was "inherently challenging" but insisted that social housing remained central to the government’s housing strategy.

The Minister highlighted the government’s £39 billion Affordable Homes Programme, running from 2026 to 2036. He said around 300,000 social and affordable homes could be delivered during that time, with at least 180,000 for social rent.  

He confirmed that 60% of the homes funded through the programme would be for social rent.  

## Funding and reforms

Mr Pennycook said the government was taking steps to make it easier for councils to build. These included:  

- allowing councils to keep all receipts from right-to-buy sales for reinvestment  
- offering a preferential borrowing rate through the Public Works Loan Board, which has already enabled £6 billion of council borrowing  
- launching a £12 million skills and capacity programme with Homes England and the Local Government Association  

The Minister also pointed to planned reforms of the right-to-buy scheme, including exemptions for newly built homes and giving councils first option to repurchase properties sold on the open market.  

## A debate still unresolved

Despite these commitments, Ms Chowns’s question about why the government will not set a clear target for social housing went unanswered. The exchange highlights a continuing debate between those calling for binding goals and a government that prefers flexibility, even while promising the "biggest increase in social and affordable house building in a generation."
