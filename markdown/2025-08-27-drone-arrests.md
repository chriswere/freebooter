title: Two arrested after drone incident at prison
---

Two men have been arrested after a drone was reported flying over HMP Long Lartin in South Littleton, Worcestershire, on Monday night (18 August).

Police were called around 11.50pm after the drone dropped a package of suspected contraband before flying away. A blue Seat Leon believed to be linked to the incident was later stopped at Stafford services on the M6.

Two men in their 20s were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to convey prohibited items into a prison. A drone, the car, and the recovered package have all been seized for forensic examination.

The men remain in custody while enquiries continue.
