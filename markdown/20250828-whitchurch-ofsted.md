title: Whitchurch CofE Primary rated "good" – early years provision "outstanding"
---

Whitchurch CofE Primary School, near Ross-on-Wye, has been praised by Ofsted inspectors following their visit on **25th and 26th March 2025**.  

The school, which had not been fully inspected since 2012, has been judged **“Good”** in education, behaviour, personal development, and leadership – with its **Early Years provision rated “Outstanding.”**

## Warm and inclusive community

Inspectors described Whitchurch as a **welcoming and inclusive school** with high expectations. Children receive an excellent start in the Early Years, where they quickly become independent, curious, and confident learners.  

Pupils were found to behave well, showing **trust, kindness, and friendship** in their daily interactions. They are polite, well-mannered, and keen to learn. Staff make sure pupils feel safe and listened to, creating a culture of **support and care**.

## What the school does well

- **Curriculum:** Ambitious and broad, designed to build pupils’ knowledge over time. Reading and maths lessons follow a clear structure, helping pupils revisit, learn new content, and practise regularly.  
- **Reading:** A strong priority from the start. Phonics is taught consistently by skilled staff, and books match children’s reading levels. Those who fall behind receive quick support.  
- **SEND Support:** Pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities are identified early and supported effectively. They learn alongside their peers and achieve well.  
- **Early Years:** Rated *Outstanding*. Teachers know each child well and tailor learning to their needs. A strong focus on language and communication gives children the vocabulary and confidence they need. Pupils develop excellent concentration and learning behaviours.  
- **Personal Development:** Pupils are well prepared for life in modern Britain, learning about respect, tolerance, online safety, and healthy living. Leadership opportunities, such as the School Parliament, give pupils a real voice – including helping to interview new staff.  
- **Staff and Leadership:** Teachers and support staff say morale is high. Headteacher **Beth Stevens** was praised for her leadership, and governors, led by **Ione Taylor**, were recognised for knowing the school well and providing strong support and challenge.  

## Areas to improve

Inspectors highlighted two main areas for further improvement:  

1. **Curriculum Implementation:** In some subjects, teaching does not fully match the school’s intentions. This means pupils do not always make strong connections between topics.  
2. **Checking Understanding:** Sometimes misconceptions are not corrected quickly enough, so pupils can repeat errors. The school needs to strengthen systems for checking what children know and remember.
