<h1>Monmouthshire tree works approved across the county</h1>
<div class="articledate">27 August 2025</div>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a range of tree maintenance
and removal applications, covering properties from Abergavenny to
Chepstow. The decisions, all finalised on 26 August, reflect ongoing
efforts to manage tree health, safety, and property access across the
county.</p>
<p>In Abergavenny, five trees at 15 Wedgwood Gardens will undergo
maintenance. Two ash trees suffering from ash dieback will be reduced to
monoliths to allow regeneration, while two further ash trees leaning
over Hillside Road will have overhanging branches removed and crowns
thinned to address safety concerns. A sweet chestnut at the property
will also have branches removed where they overhang the road.</p>
<p>In Caldicot, the council approved the removal of a conifer at 45
Church Road, while at 34 Woodside, Llanbadoc, a leylandi and a conifer
on the driveway side of the property are also set to be removed.</p>
<p>At Silver How, Llanhennock, more extensive works were approved across
a number of trees, including crown reductions on silver birch and oak
trees, removal of deadwood from beech trees, and the felling of a dead
beech, an ash, and an elm tree. These works aim to ensure the safety and
long-term health of the gardenâ€™s tree collection.</p>
<p>In Chepstow, two mature walnut trees at Crossways Farm, alongside
Wintour Close, will undergo crown thinning of up to 20% and crown
lifting to remove lower limbs overhanging the pavement and driveway.</p>
<p>At Bushes Farm, Chapel Road, Earlswood, Shirenewton, the council
approved the discharge of Condition 8 linked to a previous planning
decision, allowing tree-related works on the site to proceed in line
with the approved plans.</p>
<p>Other approved works include reduction and shaping of cherry and
hawthorn trees at Applecross Cottage, Mathern, felling of a Magnolia
tree at Masonic Hall, Monmouth, and a 30% crown reduction to a Sycamore
tree at 9 Company Farm Drive, Llanfoist.</p>
