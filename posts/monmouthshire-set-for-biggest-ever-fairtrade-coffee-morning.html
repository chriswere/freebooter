		<h1>Monmouthshire set for biggest-ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning</h1>

<p>Monmouthshire schools and community groups are being invited to take part in the county’s largest-ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning during this year’s Fairtrade Fortnight, running from 22 September to 5 October.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to raise awareness not just of the social impact of Fairtrade, but also its environmental benefits. Coffee production can contribute to tropical deforestation, but Fairtrade-certified coffee guarantees that farmers are paid a fair price while ensuring that native forests remain protected.</p>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council and local Fairtrade Town groups are encouraging schools and community groups to host their own coffee morning at a time that suits them during the Fortnight. Participating schools will receive Fairtrade coffee for their staff rooms and can take part in a free online, interactive lesson from the charity Size of Wales, which explores the link between coffee and tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Some lucky schools will also have the chance to win extra treats, including a Fairtrade chocolate brownie-making workshop or a visit from a Ugandan coffee farmer, who will share how Fairtrade has positively impacted her community.</p>
<p>Councillor Catrin Maby, Cabinet Member for Climate and Environment, said:
“More and more people know now about the difference that buying Fairtrade makes to the lives of growers and producers, but not so many people are aware of the environmental benefits that Fairtrade brings. That’s why we want lots of schools and groups to get involved in the biggest ever Fairtrade Coffee Morning to help get the message out there!”</p>
<p>Schools and community groups can register to take part by contacting hazelclatworthy@monmouthshire.gov.uk.</p>
