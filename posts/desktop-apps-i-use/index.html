<h1>Desktop apps I use</h1>
23 August 2025
<p>Just like <em>former</em> MP Jacob Rees-Mogg showing the world that
he <a
href="https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/picture-of-rees-moggs-desk-shows-he-doesnt-use-a-computer-and-nobody-is-surprised-322645">doesn’t
have a computer in his office</a>, I too shall share my daily workflow.
Unlike Mister Rees-Mogg, I know how to use a computer (most of the
time).</p>
<p>All apps mentioned here are <em>free and open source</em> and most
should be available in most Linux distro repositories.</p>
<h2 id="web-browser">Web browser</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a>: My day-to-day
browser of choice, I use the ESR version which usually seems like the
least enshittified version, but I’m certainly not happy with how Mozilla
have been behaving.</li>
<li><a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net">Lynx</a>: The browser I
use to read articles from my RSS reader. It does a great job of
bypassing many of the annoyances of the modern web.</li>
<li><a href="https://qutebrowser.org">Qutebrowser</a>: I’ve been trying
out Qutebrowser lately. Whilst I’m quite enjoying it, the lack of
<em>Ublock Origin level</em> ad-blocking, as well as the lack of a
in-built password manager are two factors I’m learning to work out.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="password-manager">Password manager</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://keepassxc.org">KeePassXC</a>: One of the best
password managers around, it also comes with the package
<em>keepassxc-cli</em> which is a command line interface for KeePassXC
I’ve been getting used to using.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rss-reader">RSS reader</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://newsboat.org">Newsboat</a>: I have used many, many
RSS readers over the years, and this is by far my favourite. I’ve hooked
it in to use the text-only browser Lynx to read articles which don’t
publish full articles in the feed and it’s a very pleasant way to
catch-up on the web. For those who want a GUI RSS reader, I can
recommend <a
href="https://github.com/patchedsoul/news-flash">NewsFlash</a>. People
have been recommending <a
href="https://codeberg.org/newsraft/newsraft">Newsraft</a> but I haven’t
got round to giving it a spin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a>: I know many folks detest
this for image editing, but it’s the first one I learnt to effectively
use and I’ve become familiar with it. Whilst it may not be the best FOSS
has to offer, it’s certainly good enough for me.</li>
<li><a href="https://inkscape.org/en">Inkscape</a>: I use Inkscape for
all my vector-based graphics. It does everything that I need to do as is
an excellent piece of FOSS software.</li>
<li><a
href="https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama">Pixelorama</a>:
simple, intuitive pixel art tool, on Itch and <a
href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama">Steam</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scribus.net">Scribus</a>: Fantastic desktop
publishing package. I’ve used this for so many project, including,
leaflets, magazines, and even a billboard once.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kdenlive.org">Kdenlive</a>: I use the Kdenlive
AppImage for all my video editing. It does everything I need and
more.</li>
<li><a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS (Open Broadcaster
Software)</a>: Screen recorder and livestreaming software, very feature
complete.</li>
<li><a
href="http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder">SimpleScreenRecorder</a>:
Screen recorder, not as full-featured as OBS but a useful lighter
recorder.</li>
</ul>
