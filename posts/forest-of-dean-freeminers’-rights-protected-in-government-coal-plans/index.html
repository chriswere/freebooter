<h1>Forest of Dean Freeminers’ rights protected in Government coal plans</h1>
<div class="articledate">28 August 2025</div>
<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has pressed the government on its plans
to restrict new coal mining licences, asking how his department will
protect the unique rights of local Freeminers (7 July 2025).</p>
<p>Mister Bishop asked the Secretary of State for Energy Security and
Net Zero what progress had been made on legislative proposals to amend
the Coal Industry Act 1994, ensuring that new coal extraction licences
would be prohibited, while safeguarding Freeminers’ centuries-old
rights.</p>
<p>Michael Shanks, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the
Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed that the
government intends to introduce the legislation “as soon as possible.”
He reassured that the historic rights of Freeminers in the Forest of
Dean will be fully exempted, allowing them to continue mining under
their traditional rules.</p>
<p>Freemining is a rare and historic custom, dating back to 1244. To
become a Freeminer, an individual must be born and bred within the
“Hundred of St Briavels,” be at least 21 years old, and have worked a
year and a day in a mine. Registered Freeminers are entitled to mine
personal plots, known as gales. Since the 1840s, more than 4,300
Freeminers have been registered, and in 2010 women were included for the
first time.</p>
<p>Mining has shaped the Forest of Dean for centuries and continues to
influence local life. Notably, the Forest of Dean Cycle Centre is built
on a former colliery site, with the old mine’s terrain providing ideal
conditions for downhill trails.</p>
<p>Bishop said he welcomed the government’s commitment, highlighting the
importance of protecting the Forest’s historic mining traditions while
moving forward with modern energy policy.</p>
