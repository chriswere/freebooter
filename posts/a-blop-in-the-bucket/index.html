<h1>A blop in the bucket</h1>
17 August 2025
<p>Much like <a
href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/liz-truss-tank-estonia-margaret-thatcher_uk_61a60ddfe4b025be1aee877e">Liz
Truss</a> driving a tank into Estonia, I’m going to do something
confusing and likely foolhardy: rebuild the pride and joy of my digital
presence with <a href="https://friendo.monster">Drew’s</a> static
website builder, <a href="https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop">blop</a>. I’m a
big lover of static sites for all the use cases you can apply them to.
They’re faster, more stable, more portable, require fewer dependencies
and resources, and you generally have more control over them when it
comes to administrative tasks. Fellow <a
href="https://video.thepolarbear.co.uk/c/expanse/videos">Space
Virgin</a>, <a href="https://thepolarbear.co.uk">Hamish the Polarbear’s
website</a>, is also static, being a gentleman of refined taste and
all.</p>
<p>So, what is this blorp?</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s ‘blop’. Secondly, the project page defines blop
succinctly: “blop essentially just converts markdown into HTML in a
lightly structured way. Run blop in a directory where you want the local
copy of your blog to live and then upload/push the resulting HTML to
your website.” Thirdly, the Urban Dictionary defines blop thusly: “<a
href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blop">the sound of
jelly when it falls off your knife onto the floor</a>.” Please don’t
look at the subsequent definitions, you won’t like them.</p>
<p>I wanted to get back into writing, make my website somewhere more
interesting to visit, and align myself with the small/smol web. Every
now and then, I want to tinker with this little facet of my personality.
The last time I made a significant change here was the new ‘picnic
style’ theme. I considered giving Hugo and E11y a shot, but they both
felt like more than I needed. Additionally, Drew had been keeping blop
ticking over for years now, and it always seemed to work well for him. I
mean, all I need is something to convert .md files into an HTML template
and assemble an RSS feed.</p>
<p>The RSS feed was important, in fact, I was even considering creating
an RSS feed-only blog at one point. I’ve recently been getting into <a
href="https://newsboat.org">Newsboat</a>, a command line RSS reader that
fits the way I like to read perfectly. People have been recommending <a
href="https://codeberg.org/newsraft/newsraft">Newsraft</a>, but I’ve yet
to give that a go. I tend to opt for what’s available in the Debian
stable repositories as a broad, albeit sometimes broken, rule.</p>
<p>Not many people get the privilege of having the creator of a piece of
software available to personally offer a step-by-step guide on getting
all the templates set up, but Drew, being one of the kindest people I
know and one of my best friends, took the time to get me set up nicely,
even though he was having a migraine (or, as I like to call them, blood
attacks).</p>
<p>I managed to migrate a lot of my old website content over very
easily, as is the beauty of working with plain text. I never cared much
for having too many images on my website, waste of space and bandwidth
if you ask me.</p>
<p>All in all, blop is everything I need and want out of a static site
generator, and I’m incredibly grateful to Drew for putting it together.
I’ve even made myself a little script to push the changes easily. Due to
this new workflow, I’m now hosting this site on <a
href="https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages">Codeberg Pages</a>.</p>
<p>So, how does it work?</p>
<p>Well, you simply pull all the files from the <a
href="https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop">blop project page</a> using git, or
a web browser if you prefer. Adjust the templates, style.css, url.txt,
site.conf, and add your posts in the form of markdown files in the
markdown folder, then run blop. Sidenote: I’ve placed blop in my
~/.local/bin folder, where I keep all my local executables, but you can
stick it anywhere you like. The <a
href="https://gitlab.com/uoou/blop/-/blob/master/README.md">full
documentation</a> has all the settings options as well as details on how
to get your blop site set up properly.</p>
<p>To top it all off, I’ve set up a little script that compiles the site
and pushes it up to Codeberg. While the script is very basic, all of my
work can be seen on the <a
href="https://codeberg.org/ChrisWere/pages">Codeberg project page for my
site</a>. A big thanks to Codeberg, by the way, for being such a
wonderfully supportive institution in the free software and open-source
world, as well as a big thank you to Drew for taking the time to put
together this tool and walk me through using it.</p>
