<h1>UK justice system faces urgent reforms amid backlogs and calls to protect jury trials</h1>
<div class="articledate">28 August 2025</div>
<p>The House of Commons heard extensive debate (9 July) on the state of
the UK criminal justice system, as MPs pressed the Government on
backlogs, court delays, and the future of jury trials. The discussion
followed the release of Sir Brian Leveson’s report, which called for
once-in-a-generation reforms to improve efficiency and ensure timely
justice.</p>
<p>Labour MPs highlighted the human cost of the backlog, noting that
under the previous Conservative Government, 60% of rape victims
abandoned their cases due to lengthy delays. Minister of State for
Justice Sarah Sackman acknowledged the scale of the problem, emphasizing
investment in victims’ services, the strengthening of the Victims’ Code,
and the critical need for timely trials.</p>
<p>Local justice concerns were raised by Plaid Cymru’s Liz
Saville-Roberts, who pointed to underfunding, court closures, and staff
shortages affecting magistrates courts. Sackman confirmed the Government
would pursue whole-system reforms rather than piecemeal changes, while
noting that investments had already been made to maintain and improve
court infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sackman defended the Government’s record on prison investment, noting
that 14,000 new prison places had been committed alongside sentencing
reforms and £450 million allocated to courts. She stressed that
additional Crown Court sitting days—over 4,000 more than previously
agreed—were part of the effort to tackle delays, but structural reform
remained essential.</p>
<p>The debate also focused on the role of jury trials. Concerns were
raised about any potential erosion of the right to a jury, with MPs
warning that such changes could undermine public confidence. Sackman
repeatedly reassured the House that jury trials would remain central for
serious cases, while noting that Sir Brian Leveson’s recommendations
emphasized proportionate reforms to ensure timely justice. She argued
that the current system’s delays, not trial format, posed the greatest
threat to both victims and defendants.</p>
<p>Questions were also raised about plea bargaining, with opposition MPs
urging the Government to rule out reducing sentences by up to 40% for
guilty pleas—a practice common in the United States. Sackman confirmed
the Government had no intention of replicating the US system and
emphasized careful policy development to balance swifter justice with
public protection.</p>
<p>Some MPs suggested adopting practices from other jurisdictions,
including intensive supervision courts and faster hearings for domestic
abuse cases. Sackman said the Government would consider lessons from
abroad, alongside preventive interventions and rehabilitation programs,
to reduce reoffending and relieve court backlogs.</p>
<p>The debate underscored a shared recognition across parties that the
UK criminal justice system is at a critical juncture. Sackman stressed
that reform, investment, and engagement with legal professionals would
be central to addressing backlogs, protecting victims, and maintaining
public confidence in both jury trials and the wider judicial
process.</p>
