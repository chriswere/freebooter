<p>Residents living near Staunton Road in Coleford are being notified of a new application that could see a fleet of heavy goods vehicles operating from the area.</p>
<p>Hopkins Concrete Ltd, based at Trinity Park in Birmingham, has applied for a Goods Vehicle Operatorâ€™s Licence. If granted, the licence would allow the company to run up to 12 lorries (with no trailers) from the Tarmac Ltd site on Staunton Road, Coleford (GL16 8NS).</p>
<p>People who own or live on land near the site have the right to raise concerns if they believe their property use or enjoyment would be affected by the operation.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to make a representation must write to the Traffic Commissioner at Quarry House, Quarry Hill, Leeds, LS2 7UE within 21 days of this notice being published. A copy of the objection must also be sent to Hopkins Concrete Ltd at its registered Birmingham address.</p>
<p>The government has published detailed guidance on how to make an objection, available here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-guide-to-making-representations-objections-and-complaints-goods-vehicle-operator-licensing">www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-guide-to-making-representations-objections-and-complaints-goods-vehicle-operator-licensing</a>.</p>
