<h1>Ambitious plans for Five Acres laid out by council</h1>
<div class="articledate">27 August 2025</div>
<p>The Forest of Dean District Council has unveiled an ambitious new
vision for <strong>Five Acres</strong> in Berry Hill, creating a hub of
leisure, education, and community activities for residents across the
district. The project is designed to bring people together, provide
modern facilities, and support the health and wellbeing of the local
community.</p>
<h2 id="phase-one-indoor-facilities-and-community-spaces">Phase one:
indoor facilities and community spaces</h2>
<p>The first phase of the redevelopment focuses on the
<strong>refurbishment of the former Speedwell Building</strong> and the
creation of new indoor leisure facilities. Plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>large 53-station gym</strong> for all ages and
abilities<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Power-assisted exercise rooms</strong> and group exercise
space<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Soft play areas</strong> and party rooms for children<br />
</li>
<li>A <strong>café</strong> for visitors<br />
</li>
<li>Repurposed upper floors of the Speedwell Building for <strong>office
and community space</strong><br />
</li>
<li>A dedicated <strong>outreach space for Hartpury University’s
Aspiration Centre</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>New car parking</strong> and a secure <strong>cycle parking
facility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The designs have been carefully developed with input from residents
and community groups, ensuring that the facilities meet local needs
while remaining <strong>financially and environmentally
sustainable</strong>. Energy-efficient features such as <strong>air
source heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, and electric vehicle
charging points</strong> are included to ensure a long-term positive
impact.</p>
<h2 id="phase-two-outdoor-sports-facilities">Phase two: outdoor sports
facilities</h2>
<p>The second phase focuses on the <strong>3G artificial pitch</strong>,
which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>full-size pitch</strong> suitable for football and rugby
training and competitive games<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Floodlights and spectator area</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Compliance with <strong>World Rugby Reg22 standards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This phase is part of a successful funding bid to the
<strong>Football Association</strong> in January 2025. A
<strong>planning application (P0087/25/FUL)</strong> has been submitted
and is under consideration.</p>
<p>The pitch location has been carefully chosen due to site constraints
such as a capped mining shaft and tree root protection zones. It is
designed to meet the growing demand for 3G pitches in the district,
which currently has a shortfall of two full-size pitches for local
teams.</p>
<h2 id="future-expansion-and-flexibility">Future expansion and
flexibility</h2>
<p>Although the initial plans do not include a swimming pool or new
tennis courts, the design leaves <strong>space for future
expansion</strong>. The Sports Hall has been reoriented, and corridors
included to allow for potential future facilities without disrupting
current operations.</p>
<p>A <strong>small performance venue</strong> will be included in the
Sports Hall, allowing for exhibitions, static displays, or live
performances. Retractable bleacher seating for up to 450 people could be
added in future phases if funding becomes available.</p>
<p>The athletics track, owned by Five Acres High School, could be
upgraded in the future with support from the council and advice from
England Athletics.</p>
<h2 id="education-and-community-partnerships">Education and community
partnerships</h2>
<p>Hartpury University and College will <strong>lease two rooms</strong>
within the refurbished Speedwell Building for its <strong>Aspiration
Centre</strong>, creating a local outreach hub. This centre will provide
programmes and activities aimed at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising aspirations among young people in the Forest of Dean<br />
</li>
<li>Promoting further and higher education opportunities<br />
</li>
<li>Supporting business and employer pathways</li>
</ul>
<p>The partnership with Hartpury also aims to <strong>reduce travel and
carbon emissions</strong> for students by bringing education closer to
home.</p>
<h2 id="funding-and-redevelopment">Funding and redevelopment</h2>
<p>The redevelopment is being funded by the council through a
<strong>successful Levelling Up Fund bid</strong>, which also
supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>flagship University, Careers &amp; Enterprise Learning
Centre</strong> and electric vehicle car park at Hartpury<br />
</li>
<li>Transformation of <strong>three prominent buildings in Cinderford
town centre</strong> to support businesses, social enterprises,
training, and the arts</li>
</ul>
<p>The council purchased the Five Acres site from <strong>Homes England
in December 2021 for £1</strong>, with the goal of creating a new
council-owned leisure and community destination. Demolition of the
previous structures has been completed, and the site is now cleared and
ready for construction.</p>
<h2 id="community-consultation">Community consultation</h2>
<p>Early consultation events were held at <strong>Berry Hill Primary
School</strong> and <strong>Five Acres High School</strong>, helping
shape the phased design approach. Further community information events
will be organised as the project progresses, keeping residents updated
on plans for both indoor and outdoor facilities.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</h2>
<p>The council’s vision for Five Acres is to create a <strong>hub for
community activity</strong> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sports and leisure facilities for all ages<br />
</li>
<li>Spaces for socialising and community groups<br />
</li>
<li>Opportunities for small businesses to start or grow<br />
</li>
<li>Potential for a hotel to support local tourism in future phases</li>
</ul>
<p>The project aligns with the <strong>Allocations Plan</strong> and the
<strong>Berry Hill, Christchurch, and Edge End Neighbourhood
Plan</strong>, ensuring it meets local planning and community
objectives.</p>
<h2 id="key-facts-about-facilities">Key facts about facilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swimming pool</strong>: No current plans due to lack of
funding. Space is reserved for future development.<br />

rugby, with planned community use from 5-9pm weekdays and potential
