<p>Monmouthshire County Council has refused a planning application to convert paddock land at Swallows Nest, Ty‚Äôr Pwll, Parc Llettis Road, Hardwick, Abergavenny, into a glamping site. The decision follows a Planning Committee meeting on 1 July 2025, where councillors rejected the officer recommendation for approval and voted unanimously to refuse the application.</p>
