<h1>Bungalow approved for rear of Park Close property after controversial debate</h1>
<div class="articledate">26 August 2025</div>
<p>A controversial plan to build a bungalow in the back garden of a Park
Close home has been given the green light by Monmouthshire County
Council, following months of debate and several amendments to the
scheme.</p>
<p>The planning meeting can be view on <a

<p>The application sought permission to construct a single-storey
property with its own parking and turning space behind 11 Park Close in
Abergavenny.</p>
<p>The scheme was first brought before councillors in January, when it
faced strong opposition over the narrow three-metre access lane, which
fell short of Welsh planning standards. A tied vote in February left the
decision hanging, but the applicant later submitted revised plans with
improved parking and manoeuvring space, as well as details on drainage
and biodiversity measures.</p>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council maintained its objection, raising issues
around drainage, biodiversity, and potential access disputes between
neighbours. Several local residents also criticised the plan, warning of
loss of green space, privacy concerns, and overdevelopment of the
area.</p>
<p>Despite these objections, county highways officers withdrew their
earlier concerns, concluding that the updated design provided safe
access and sufficient parking. Biodiversity officers accepted new
measures, including bird boxes, hedgehog-friendly fencing, and
landscaping, while flood and drainage specialists confirmed that surface
water could be managed through a Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS).
Archaeologists also noted that the site sits in a sensitive area,
requiring mitigation work during construction.</p>
<p>Planning officers recommended approval, highlighting that the
bungalow’s design was modest, single-storey, and in keeping with the
area, with minimal impact on neighbouring homes. Councillors agreed,
granting permission subject to strict conditions — including removal of
permitted development rights, landscaping requirements, and a financial
contribution towards affordable housing.</p>
