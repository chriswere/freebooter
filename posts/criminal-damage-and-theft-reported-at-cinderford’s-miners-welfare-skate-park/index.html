<p>Cinderford Town Council has reported a rise in incidents of criminal
damage at the Miners Welfare Skate Park, with police now
investigating.</p>
<p>The North Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) confirmed they are
working with the council following several recent reports, including the
theft of a safety chain from a swing. This is the second time in recent
weeks that a safety chain has been stolen from the park.</p>
<p>The missing chain presents a serious risk to users if it goes
unnoticed, and the council has warned that continued vandalism could
lead to certain equipment being cordoned off in the interest of public
safety.</p>
<p>The Town Council and police have reminded residents that the skate
park is a community facility, provided for public enjoyment, and should
be treated with care and respect. Residents are asked to help protect
and preserve the site.</p>
