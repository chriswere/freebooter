</ul></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Labour says the Bill will “make work pay” and improve job security. The <strong>Green Party, Plaid Cymru, the SNP, and independent MPs</strong> have supported the plans, saying they will help protect workers after years of insecure and unfair contracts.</p>
<p>Employers are being advised to prepare now, especially for the changes due in <strong>autumn 2025</strong> and <strong>April 2026</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="not-law-yet">Not law yet</h2>
<p>The Bill is <strong>not law yet</strong>. Until it receives <strong>Royal Assent</strong> from the King, the current rules remain in place.</p>
