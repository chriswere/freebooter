<h1>Monmouth MP makes case for Magor and Undy station in Commons debate</h1>
<div class="articledate">28 August 2025</div>
<p>Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes made a strong case in the House of
Commons (8 July 2025) for a new station at Magor and Undy, highlighting
its potential to transform local transport and open up jobs for
residents without cars. Speaking during a debate on road and rail
projects, Fookes welcomed the Government’s “ramped up” spending and the
£445 million earmarked for Wales in the recent spending review.</p>
<p>Fookes argued that the Magor and Undy station could reduce congestion
on the M4 while giving people without cars better access to employment
opportunities. She suggested that the site could be an ideal candidate
for one of the first five “Burns stations,” thanks to existing track and
infrastructure already in place.</p>
<p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander praised Fookes for her advocacy,
describing her as “a fearsome champion” for the station. Alexander
confirmed the £445 million would be spread over the next ten years to
correct historic underinvestment in Welsh rail and said the Wales Rail
Board would set priorities to ensure communities like Fookes’ benefit
from the funding.</p>
<p>The debate also saw Plaid Cymru MP Ann Davies raise concerns that the
£445 million would cover just five stations, leaving areas west of
Cardiff, such as St Clears, without support despite long-standing
promises. Alexander defended the funding, describing it as a “step
change” for Welsh rail, covering both development projects and new
infrastructure across south and north Wales, and offered to discuss
specific local schemes further.</p>
<p>Fookes’ intervention highlighted the importance of investing in local
transport links to both tackle congestion and improve access to jobs.
Her call for Magor and Undy to become an early Burns station signals a
potential turning point for the region’s transport network, promising
tangible benefits for residents and local commuters alike.</p>
