<h1>Abergavenny restaurant sign dispute sparks heritage row </h1>
<div class="articledate">26 August 2025</div>
<p>A retrospective bid to keep two illuminated fascia signs at a popular
Abergavenny restaurant has divided opinion — with planning officers
recommending refusal but councillors voting to defer a final
decision.</p>
<p>The application, lodged by Mr Peter Woolley for <strong>Il
Gusto</strong> at <strong>43 Frogmore Street</strong>, sought to retain
two internally illuminated signs already installed on the shopfront. The
site lies in the <strong>Abergavenny Conservation Area</strong>, within
the town’s historic core and close to several listed buildings,
including the Baptist Church and the War Memorial.</p>
<p>The planning meeting where this was decided can be viewed on <a

<h2 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h2>
<p>The two fascia signs, each around 3 metres wide and 0.6 metres high,
feature <strong>white text on a black PVC background</strong>. They are
static, internally lit, with a brightness of <strong>300 cd/m²</strong>,
and sit above the restaurant frontage at a height of 2.65 metres.</p>
<p>The application is <strong>retrospective</strong>, as the signs have
already been fitted without formal consent. Earlier permissions for the
site (2015) had allowed only <strong>externally illuminated
signage</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-the-signs">Support for the signs</h2>
<p>The application has received <strong>12 neighbour comments</strong>,
all supportive. Local residents and customers described the signs as
<em>“tasteful”</em>, <em>“elegant”</em>, and <em>“in keeping with the
town’s character”</em>.</p>
<p>Supporters argued the signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help small businesses stand out in the evening economy</li>
<li>Contribute to a vibrant town centre</li>
<li>Are no brighter than existing signage, including Tesco opposite</li>
<li>Compare favourably to other national chains that have been granted
internally lit signs in Abergavenny</li>
</ul>
<p>Abergavenny Town Council and the Abergavenny &amp; District Civic
Society also backed the application, stressing the need for
<strong>consistency</strong> and updated guidance for shopfronts in
conservation areas.</p>
<p>Local councillor Laura Wright also weighed in, calling the signage
<em>“not problematic within the conservation area”</em>. She said
illumination levels were modest, switched off at 10pm, and no different
to signage that had been in place at the site for years. <em>“Supporting
local businesses in our town centre is vital,”</em> she added.</p>
<h2 id="heritage-and-officer-concerns">Heritage and officer
concerns</h2>
<p>Despite this, <strong>Monmouthshire County Council’s heritage
officers</strong> strongly opposed the scheme. They argued that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internally illuminated PVC signage is <strong>modern and out of
keeping</strong> with the Conservation Area.</li>
<li>Conservation policy favours <strong>matt finishes and traditional
materials</strong> like timber.</li>
<li>The shiny finish and internal lighting make the signs <em>“starkly
modern”</em> and intrusive against nearby historic shopfronts.</li>
</ul>
<p>They suggested a compromise: disconnecting the internal lights and
replacing the glossy fascia with a <strong>matt wrap and external
downlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Planning officers echoed these concerns, citing <strong>Local
Development Plan policies DES3 and HE3</strong>, which require signage
in conservation areas to preserve character. They concluded the signs
had a <strong>“detrimental impact”</strong> on the appearance of the
historic core, particularly when lit at night.</p>
<h2 id="the-committee-debate">The committee debate</h2>
<p>At committee, officers recommended refusal. But councillors were
split. Some argued the rules were being applied too harshly to an
independent business, particularly given the presence of other
illuminated signage nearby.</p>
<p>When put to the vote, the motion to refuse failed — <strong>5 in
favour, 9 against</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, members resolved to <strong>defer</strong> the decision.
Officers were asked to negotiate with the applicant’s agent to find a
compromise, likely involving adjustments to the finish or lighting
method, before bringing the case back with a <strong>recommendation for
approval with conditions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2>
<p>The fate of Il Gusto’s signs now hangs in the balance. The restaurant
can continue trading with the current signage in place while discussions
continue.</p>
<p>If a compromise is agreed, councillors are expected to approve the
signs at a future meeting, bringing an end to a row that has highlighted
the <strong>tension between conservation rules and the needs of modern
businesses</strong> in Abergavenny’s town centre.</p>
