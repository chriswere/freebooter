<p><strong>Full Council – Tuesday 8th July 2025, 7pm–9pm</strong></p>
<p>Coleford Town Council met on Tuesday 8th July with Councillors
discussing a wide range of community matters, from staff appraisals and
Active Travel projects to memorial benches and local awards.</p>
<h2 id="key-decisions-and-updates">Key Decisions and Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Staff appraisals</strong><br />
The Town Clerk confirmed that appraisals had been completed for the
Assistant Clerk and Administrator. Both will receive a one-point salary
increase in line with contracts. A review process will be looked into
for Admin Officer K Hughes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flag flying requests</strong><br />
Councillors agreed that in future the Union Flag should fly on the Clock
Tower throughout Armed Forces Week, while the Pride flag will be flown
either side of this week and for the whole of June at Bells
Field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active travel project</strong><br />
Progress was reported on the cycle and walking path. To manage costs,
the scheme will now be split into three phases, with work linked to
funding from the Rural England Prosperity Fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>CTC will fund the project, but long-term maintenance will remain
with the landowner (FoDDC).<br />
</li>
<li>The Co-op section will be held back for possible action later due to
high legal fees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rural England Prosperity Fund (REPF)
applications</strong><br />
Councillors discussed three potential projects, including a “pocket
park” with an industrial-meets-nature theme linked to the Railway
Museum. Local schools and artists may be involved in shaping the design.
The Council team has delegated authority to develop the
application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cemetery projects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised about water damage affecting the Cemetery
plinth mural. Councillors agreed to rethink the project and possibly
halt it if necessary.<br />
</li>
<li>A request for a memorial bench in the Garden of Remembrance was
approved, with the condition that it could be moved in future if the
area is extended.<br />
</li>
<li>A new noticeboard will be installed at the Cemetery, with an oak
frame and green background, subject to checking existing storage.<br />
</li>
<li>Councillors reaffirmed the policy that memorial benches are only
allowed in the Cemetery, not in the town centre.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other local matters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bench request in Sylvan Close was approved, with fencing to be
installed by TEK Fencing including anti-vandal wire.<br />
</li>
<li>Phone boxes: one in Coalway may be relocated within the parish,
while the Sunnybank box will be sold to Greenacres for £250, with
removal and land restoration to be completed within six months.<br />
</li>
<li>The King George V pavilion’s electrical safety certificate (EICR)
has been completed and urgent items addressed. The clock will also be
repaired.<br />
</li>
<li>A proposal for an Angus Buchanan bust was declined due to cost.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Speed limit review</strong><br />
Councillors will consider supporting 20mph zones where evidence or
statistics show a clear need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community &amp; awards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The GGP Community Builder scheme was deemed district-wide and not a
priority for CTC at present.<br />
</li>
<li>The Council decided not to fund sponsorship of the <em>Forest
Review</em> Local Heroes Mayor’s Award, as it duplicates Coleford’s own
community awards. However, they will nominate Erin Burke as “Sporting
Hero” and Cllr Nick Penny will attend.<br />
</li>
<li>Cllr M Getgood was nominated to speak at a forthcoming Climate
Adaptation Workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Citizen visioning</strong><br />
Six councillors attended the final presentation. While feedback was
mixed on the process, the passion of participants was noted. A formal
report is expected by the end of July.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Police update</strong><br />
Police statistics were noted. Concerns were raised about drug use and
dealing in the town. Coleford has been added to the national “Summer
Blitz” scheme.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Document Retention Policy will now keep safeguarding records for
30 years, in line with insurance requirements.<br />
</li>
<li>The Council adopted a new Expenses Policy, including mileage
incentives for car-sharing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
