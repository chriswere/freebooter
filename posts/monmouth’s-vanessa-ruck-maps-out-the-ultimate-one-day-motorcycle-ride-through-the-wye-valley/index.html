<p>Monmouth motorcyclist and social media personality <a
href="https://thegirlonabike.com">Vanessa Ruck</a> – widely known as The

“ultimate one-day motorcycle trip in the UK,” starting and finishing in
the Wye Valley.</p>

<p>The route showcases some of the area’s best riding roads, including
the A466 from Chepstow to Monmouth, the B4235, the A4136 towards Symonds
Yat, and a return stretch along the River Wye. The ride is designed to
highlight both the scenery and the wealth of local stop-offs that make
the valley such a draw for visitors.</p>

of her journey</a>.</p>
<p>Among the suggested breaks are Monmouth’s historic high street and
picnic area, the Lion Inn at Trellech, and Symonds Yat Rock with its
panoramic views across the valley. Other recommended stops include
Tintern Abbey, the Old Station Tintern, and Bigsweir Bridge – one of the
most photographed crossings of the River Wye.</p>
<p>Vanessa, who has built an online following of more than 460,000
across her channels, has become known for her motorcycle adventures and
honest storytelling. After a road traffic accident in 2014 left her
facing seven surgeries and years of recovery, she turned to motorcycling
as both a form of escapism and a way to embrace new challenges. Since
then, she has ridden across the world, from Iceland to Bolivia, and now
shares her passion for exploring closer to home.</p>
<p>Her Wye Valley loop is promoted as a one-day ride, but she also
highlights how it can be extended into a weekend. Additional attractions
nearby include Clearwell Caves, Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean,
Goodrich Castle, and filming locations from the Netflix series Sex
Education.</p>
<p>Accommodation suggestions along the route range from local inns such
as the Lion in Trellech to guesthouses in Monmouth and Tintern, with
plenty of smaller bed and breakfasts tucked away in the surrounding
countryside.</p>
<p>With its combination of winding woodland roads, historic landmarks
and riverside views, the route underlines why the Wye Valley is so often
described as one of the UK’s most scenic regions – and now has the
endorsement of one of Monmouth’s most recognisable adventurers.</p>
