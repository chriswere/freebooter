<h1>Forest MP hits out at court backlogs and calls for reform</h1>
<div class="articledate">28 August 2025</div>
<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has warned that tackling the growing
Crown Court backlog requires more than simply adding sitting days—it
needs fundamental reform, during a commons debate (3 July).</p>
<p>“With the Crown Court backlog that we inherited at such high levels,
and continuing to rise, does the Minister agree that tackling it means
not just adding more sitting days but making fundamental reform?” Bishop
asked.</p>
<p>The Minister of State for Justice, Sarah Sackman, agreed the
situation is intolerable. She described record backlogs in the criminal
courts as having a serious human impact on victims, witnesses, and court
staff, and said radical structural reform is needed alongside increased
sitting days. Sackman cited the forthcoming work of Sir Brian Leveson
and the Ministry’s £450 million investment in courts as part of efforts
to restore confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Other MPs also spoke during the debate. Conservative Ashley Fox
warned that increasing early guilty plea discounts to 40% could
undermine trust in the system, and questioned proposals for an
“intermediate court” aimed at speeding up cases. Sackman said the
courts’ priority is delivering swift justice, not cost-saving.</p>
<p>Emily Thornberry, drawing on 20 years’ experience as a barrister,
said delays in Crown courts have led some defendants to plead “not
guilty” knowing their case would take years to reach trial. Sackman
responded that reform will consider new technologies and efficiencies
while maintaining the integrity of jury trials.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds shared his personal experience as a
juror, highlighting that jurors are often underused. Sackman said the
issue is overall system capacity—judges, lawyers, courtrooms, and
resources—not the jury system itself.</p>
<p>Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell and Uma Kumaran, stressed the
importance of restoring public confidence, particularly for victims of
crime. Kumaran highlighted that under the previous Conservative
government, 60% of rape victims withdrew their cases due to delays.
Sackman emphasised that victims must see timely justice, and investment
in victims’ services is a key part of reforms.</p>
<p>Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts warned that removing jury rights
for sentences under two years in an intermediate court would not address
years of underfunding and staff shortages in magistrates courts. Sackman
said the government aims for whole-system reform, respecting the local
role of magistrates courts while tackling the backlog across the
criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Other MPs, including Christopher Vince, noted the effects of previous
court closures on victims’ confidence, echoing calls for fundamental
reform. Sackman reiterated that the government is committed to restoring
the system, ensuring that victims receive timely justice, and addressing
the backlog comprehensively.</p>
