<h1>Monmouthshire Council approves major speed limit changes across county</h1>
<div class="articledate">26 August 2025</div>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide-ranging set of
Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) designed to improve road safety,
clarify existing speed limits, and ensure that local speed limits comply
with national regulations. The decisions were made during the Individual
Cabinet Member Decision meeting on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00
pm.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Member for Climate Change and the Environment confirmed
that a public inquiry would <strong>not</strong> be held, and that the
proposed orders would proceed as planned. Two proposals on the B4293,
Mitchell Troy, were not approved due to technical errors and will be
reviewed in the future.</p>
<h2 id="approved-speed-limit-changes">Approved Speed Limit Changes</h2>
<p>The Council approved the following speed limit changes across the
county:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redbrook Road, A466, Monmouth:</strong> A <strong>30mph
speed limit</strong> to correct a historical administrative omission.
This section was intended to operate at 30mph but was never formally
included in the legal Traffic Regulation Orders.</li>
<li><strong>A472, The Rhadyr, Usk:</strong> <strong>40mph and 30mph
limits</strong> to improve safety around the industrial BAE Systems site
and the nearby equine college, where slow-moving vehicles and pedestrian
traffic create higher risk.</li>
<li><strong>B4233, The Hendre:</strong> <strong>30mph limit</strong> to
match the residential character of the area and current national speed
limit policy.</li>
<li><strong>B4233/B4347 Junction, Rockfield:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> in a residential area with high pedestrian activity and a
complex junction layout.</li>
<li><strong>B4233, Monmouth to Rockfield:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> to create a gradual speed transition between 20mph zones,
reducing sudden changes in speed that could pose risks.</li>
<li><strong>Mitchell Troy Road, Raglan:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> to improve safety in a residential area with bends,
visibility issues, and multiple property access points.</li>
<li><strong>Staunton Road, A4136:</strong> <strong>40mph limit</strong>
in response to a collision cluster, including one fatality between 2020
and 2023.</li>
<li><strong>B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd Bach:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> extended across severe bends to address a documented
collision cluster with ten recorded incidents between 2020 and
2023.</li>
<li><strong>B4596, Llancayo:</strong> <strong>30mph buffer
zones</strong> to provide a smoother speed transition from 50mph roads
to 20mph restricted areas.</li>
<li><strong>Common Road, Mitchell Troy:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> formalised to correct an administrative oversight and
ensure legal enforceability.</li>
<li><strong>Conway Drive, Chepstow:</strong> <strong>40mph
limit</strong> replaces a short national speed limit section, creating a
consistent speed transition into the 20mph residential area.</li>
<li><strong>A466, Llandogo:</strong> Existing <strong>20mph limit
revoked</strong> to remove a redundant order; the road remains 20mph
under default regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Lane from B4293 to Park House, Itton Common:</strong>
<strong>20mph limit</strong> formalised to match existing signage and
practice.</li>
<li><strong>Crick Road, Portskewett:</strong> <strong>20mph
limit</strong> extended to cover new pedestrian infrastructure linked to
a housing development.</li>
<li><strong>B4235, Gwernesney:</strong> <strong>30mph and 40mph
limits</strong> to improve safety in the residential area and provide a
graduated transition from national speed limits.</li>
<li><strong>A466, Tintern:</strong> <strong>20mph limit</strong>
formalised to ensure compliance where sections lacked statutory backing
despite being signed as 20mph.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speed-limit-orders-not-approved">Speed limit orders not
approved</h2>
<p>The Council decided <strong>not</strong> to proceed with the
following proposals on the B4293, Mitchell Troy:</p>
<ul>
<li>40mph speed limit</li>
<li>50mph speed limit</li>
</ul>
<p>These proposals contained errors in the technical drawings, and the
Council plans to review these sections in a future consultation.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-changes-were-made">Why the changes were made</h2>
<p>The Council explained that the changes were needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address safety concerns, including areas with documented collisions
and high pedestrian activity.</li>
<li>Correct administrative and legal inconsistencies in previous Traffic
Regulation Orders.</li>
<li>Align local speed limits with national policy, including the 20mph
default for restricted roads in Wales.</li>
<li>Provide clear and enforceable speed limits to reduce confusion for
drivers.</li>
<li>Promote safer, more sustainable travel options such as walking and
cycling.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redbrook Road, Monmouth:</strong> A 30mph limit formalises
the existing arrangement for legal certainty.</li>
<li><strong>A472, Usk:</strong> 40mph and 30mph limits respond to
slow-moving industrial and equine traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Staunton Road, A4136 &amp; B4235, Chepstow to Mynydd
Bach:</strong> New limits are based on collision data to reduce
risk.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer zones (B4596, Llancayo) and residential areas
(Rockfield, The Hendre, Gwernesney):</strong> Smoother transitions and
lower speeds protect vulnerable road users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-communities">Impact on communities</h2>
<p>The Council highlighted that these changes will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve safety for children, the elderly, and people with
disabilities.</li>
<li>Encourage active and sustainable travel by making walking and
cycling safer.</li>
<li>Provide legally enforceable speed limits across the county.</li>
<li>Support social justice, safeguarding, and community cohesion in line
with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="funding-and-next-steps">Funding and next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The changes will be funded by Monmouthshire County Councilâ€™s Road
Safety and Traffic Management budget and the Welsh Government Road
Safety Grant.</li>
<li>Implementation will begin soon, with new signage and formal Traffic
Regulation Orders being put in place.</li>
<li>Residents are encouraged to follow the new speed limits and continue
reporting safety concerns to the Council.</li>
