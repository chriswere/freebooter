<p>Forest of Dean MP Matt Bishop has pressed the government on its plans to restrict new coal mining licences, asking how his department will protect the unique rights of local Freeminers (7 July 2025).</p>
<p>Mister Bishop asked the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero what progress had been made on legislative proposals to amend the Coal Industry Act 1994, ensuring that new coal extraction licences would be prohibited, while safeguarding Freeminers’ centuries-old rights.</p>
<p>Michael Shanks, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed that the government intends to introduce the legislation “as soon as possible.” He reassured that the historic rights of Freeminers in the Forest of Dean will be fully exempted, allowing them to continue mining under their traditional rules.</p>
<p>Freemining is a rare and historic custom, dating back to 1244. To become a Freeminer, an individual must be born and bred within the “Hundred of St Briavels,” be at least 21 years old, and have worked a year and a day in a mine. Registered Freeminers are entitled to mine personal plots, known as gales. Since the 1840s, more than 4,300 Freeminers have been registered, and in 2010 women were included for the first time.</p>
<p>Mining has shaped the Forest of Dean for centuries and continues to influence local life. Notably, the Forest of Dean Cycle Centre is built on a former colliery site, with the old mine’s terrain providing ideal conditions for downhill trails.</p>
<p>Bishop said he welcomed the government’s commitment, highlighting the importance of protecting the Forest’s historic mining traditions while moving forward with modern energy policy.</p>
