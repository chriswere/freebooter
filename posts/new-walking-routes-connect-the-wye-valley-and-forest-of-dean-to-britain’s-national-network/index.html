<p>A growing national project is opening up new opportunities for
walkers in the <strong>Wye Valley and Forest of Dean</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://slowways.org">Slow Ways</a>, a non-profit
initiative, is building a walking network that connects every town,
city, and national landscape in Britain. The idea is, if people know
there‚Äôs a safe and clear way to walk somewhere, they‚Äôre more likely to
do it.</p>
<p>Started in 2020 by geographer <strong>Dan Raven-Ellison</strong>,
Slow Ways has grown with the help of thousands of volunteers. Together
they have created nearly <strong>10,000 routes</strong> linking over
<strong>2,500 places</strong>. Many of these walks pass through or
connect to our area ‚Äì from the <strong>market towns of the Forest of
Dean</strong> to the villages and riverside paths of the <strong>Wye
Valley</strong>.</p>
<p>The Slow Ways routes are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be safe, direct, and accessible</li>
<li>Avoid busy roads where possible</li>
<li>Include resting places every 5‚Äì10 km</li>
<li>Pass through public transport hubs</li>
<li>Be enjoyable and easy to follow</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every path is suitable for everyone, but routes are tested by
walkers and wheelchair/scooter users. Reviews, star ratings, and surveys
help highlight surface quality, gradients, and obstacles like stiles or
mud. Routes with three or more positive reviews become ‚Äúverified‚Äù ‚Äì
tried and tested by the community.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is about more than just hiking. It encourages people to
walk or wheel for everyday journeys, like visiting friends, shopping, or
commuting, as well as for longer adventures.</p>
<p>You can explore the routes through the <strong>Slow Ways
website</strong>, their iOS and Android apps, or printed maps and
atlases. Each walk comes with practical advice and friendly tips from
other walkers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is powered by citizens, not governments ‚Äì although the team
hopes local and national authorities will support and invest in the
future of walking.</p>
<p>Their long-term vision is for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong> ‚Äì safe and inclusive routes for all
abilities</li>
<li><strong>Everywhere</strong> ‚Äì a walking network as simple to use as
the road system</li>
<li><strong>Every day</strong> ‚Äì walking and wheeling as natural parts
of daily life</li>
<li><strong>Every time</strong> ‚Äì reliable paths, with data to give
confidence before setting out</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to explore or contribute to this growing network, visit
<a href="https://slowways.org">slowways.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can also share your own experiences, review routes, and help
verify paths in the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean. Every contribution
makes a difference ‚Äì strengthening a network that connects people to
nature, to each other, and to the wider world.</p>

<strong>hello@slowways.org</strong> or find them on social media,
including Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, X, and LinkedIn. Issues can be
