<p>The Planning Inspectorate has dismissed an appeal concerning 1 Pen Y Wern Cottage, Pen Y Wern Road, Penperlleni, Goytre (NP4 0AB). The decision was issued by Zoe Baxter BSc, MSc, MRTPI, acting as an Inspector appointed by the Welsh Ministers.</p>
<p>The appeal followed the refusal of planning permission by Monmouthshire County Council in December 2024.</p>
<h2 id="appeal-details">Appeal details</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> CAS-03994-W7R9B0<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Applicant:</strong> Mr Lyndon Hawkins<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Nature of appeal:</strong> Planning permission under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> Conversion of outbuilding to two holiday lettings<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Application Ref:</strong> DM/2024/00398 (dated 25 March 2024)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Council decision:</strong> Refused 18 December 2024<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Site visit:</strong> 1 May 2025</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Appeal was <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="main-issues">Main issues</h2>
<p>The Inspector identified two main issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether the proposed development would comply with planning policies concerning residential conversions in the countryside.<br />
</li>
<li>Whether the proposed development would adversely affect the integrity of the River Usk Special Area of Conservation (SAC).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>
<h3 id="site-context">Site context</h3>
<p>The appeal site comprises an existing outbuilding within the garden of the semi-detached cottage, adjacent to the southwestern boundary and Pen Y Wern Road. Although close to Penperlleni, the property is <strong>outside the settlement boundary</strong> defined in the Monmouthshire LDP and is therefore considered to be in the countryside. During the site visit, the outbuilding was in use for storage and as a workshop.</p>
<h3 id="residential-conversion-policies">Residential conversion policies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy T2:</strong> Outside town and village boundaries, permanent serviced or self-catering visitor accommodation is permitted only if it involves <strong>re-use and adaptation of existing buildings</strong>, in compliance with Policy H4 criteria.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Policy H4:</strong> Conversion of rural buildings for residential use requires, among other things, that buildings have been used for their intended purpose for a significant period, with special scrutiny for buildings <strong>less than 10 years old</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The appellant submitted evidence that an outbuilding had existed at the site for over 70 years, including historical maps (1971) and Google Streetview images (2009, 2011).</p>
<p>However, planning permission granted in <strong>2020 (DM/2020/01459)</strong> authorized the rebuilding of the outbuilding. The new structure, while similar in size, <strong>differs in shape and position</strong>. Therefore, the outbuilding subject to the appeal has <strong>not been in use for its intended purpose for 10 years</strong>, failing the Policy H4 criterion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Inspector concluded the proposal <strong>does not comply</strong> with Policies H4 and T2 regarding residential conversions in the countryside.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="river-usk-special-area-of-conservation">River Usk Special Area of Conservation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The River Usk is a SAC protected under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.<br />
</li>
<li>Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has introduced new phosphate standards for the Wye and Usk catchments.<br />
</li>
<li>The appeal site is not on mains drainage; a <strong>private Vortex ASP sewage treatment plant</strong> was proposed.<br />
</li>
<li>The appellant provided general information on the treatment plant but <strong>no site-specific details</strong> on its location or drainage field, and no soil/percolation testing data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inspectorâ€™s conclusion:</strong> Due to limited evidence, the proposal <strong>could have a significant effect on the River Usk SAC</strong>, posing an unacceptable risk contrary to LDP Policy EP1 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.</p>
<h3 id="other-matter">Other matter</h3>
<p>The proposal could create local jobs and provide accommodation for visitors. However, the scale of the development means <strong>these benefits do not outweigh the harm</strong> identified.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proposal <strong>fails to comply with countryside conversion policies</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>The proposal <strong>poses an unacceptable risk to the River Usk SAC</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>No overriding public benefits justify granting permission.<br />
</li>
<li>In accordance with the Well-Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, the decision supports sustainable development principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final decision:</strong> The appeal is <strong>dismissed</strong>.</p>
