<p>Green MP Ellie Chowns has pressed the Labour government to set clear targets for the delivery of new social housing. Speaking during a debate in the House of Commons on 15 September 2025, Ms Chowns asked Housing Minister Mr Matthew Pennycook why the government has refused to commit to specific numbers. (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-09-15/debates/78F1791B-B4A1-4F7A-B676-6B07A9F4D56E/SocialHousing">Hansard, HC Deb, 15 September 2025, c1314</a>)</p>
<h2 id="ms-chowns-asks-why-no-targets-are-being-set">Ms Chowns asks why no targets are being set</h2>
<p>Ms Chowns asked:<br />
&gt; “Given that the Minister feels that social housing is so important, can he explain why he will not set a target for it?”</p>
<p>When Mr Pennycook avoided the direct “why,” Ms Chowns followed up simply with:<br />
&gt; “The question was why.”</p>
<h2 id="government-says-targets-are-under-review">Government says targets are under review</h2>
<p>Mr Pennycook responded that the government had discussed the issue “many, many occasions” but was still not setting a target. He argued that long-term forecasting was “inherently challenging” but insisted that social housing remained central to the government’s housing strategy.</p>
<p>The Minister highlighted the government’s £39 billion Affordable Homes Programme, running from 2026 to 2036. He said around 300,000 social and affordable homes could be delivered during that time, with at least 180,000 for social rent.</p>
<p>He confirmed that 60% of the homes funded through the programme would be for social rent.</p>
<h2 id="funding-and-reforms">Funding and reforms</h2>
<p>Mr Pennycook said the government was taking steps to make it easier for councils to build. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>allowing councils to keep all receipts from right-to-buy sales for reinvestment<br />
</li>
<li>offering a preferential borrowing rate through the Public Works Loan Board, which has already enabled £6 billion of council borrowing<br />
</li>
<li>launching a £12 million skills and capacity programme with Homes England and the Local Government Association</li>
</ul>
<p>The Minister also pointed to planned reforms of the right-to-buy scheme, including exemptions for newly built homes and giving councils first option to repurchase properties sold on the open market.</p>
<h2 id="a-debate-still-unresolved">A debate still unresolved</h2>
<p>Despite these commitments, Ms Chowns’s question about why the government will not set a clear target for social housing went unanswered. The exchange highlights a continuing debate between those calling for binding goals and a government that prefers flexibility, even while promising the “biggest increase in social and affordable house building in a generation.”</p>
