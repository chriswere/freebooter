<p>Lydney Town Council met on Monday 14th July, with councillors
discussing highways, local developments, community assets, and plans for
town improvements.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Highways and traffic</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cllr Howard met with the Lydney Highways Manager to discuss 2025/26
priorities. Speed surveys will be carried out in some areas, with the
potential for Vehicle Activated Signs (VAS) that display number plates
of speeding drivers.<br />
</li>
<li>Traffic light safety measures were also discussed: if a car runs a
red light, both sets of lights lock on red until reset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Local Development and Community Assets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates were given on Grove Lane development, with ecological
concerns possibly affecting plans.<br />

changes in law mean the council could reapply to register the Newerne
Street GP Surgery as a Community Asset.<br />

District Hospital as a Community Asset at this time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forest gateway project</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cllr R Holmes reported on discussions with West Dean Parish Council.
Objections have been raised over ecology concerns, and independent
surveys of bats, dormice, flora, and fauna could cost around
Â£17,000.</li>
