<p>Whitchurch CofE Primary School, near Ross-on-Wye, has been praised by
Ofsted inspectors following their visit on <strong>25th and 26th March
2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The school, which had not been fully inspected since 2012, has been
judged <strong>‚ÄúGood‚Äù</strong> in education, behaviour, personal
development, and leadership ‚Äì with its <strong>Early Years provision
rated ‚ÄúOutstanding.‚Äù</strong></p>
<h2 id="warm-and-inclusive-community">Warm and inclusive community</h2>
<p>Inspectors described Whitchurch as a <strong>welcoming and inclusive
school</strong> with high expectations. Children receive an excellent
start in the Early Years, where they quickly become independent,
curious, and confident learners.</p>
<p>Pupils were found to behave well, showing <strong>trust, kindness,
and friendship</strong> in their daily interactions. They are polite,
well-mannered, and keen to learn. Staff make sure pupils feel safe and
listened to, creating a culture of <strong>support and
care</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-school-does-well">What the school does well</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> Ambitious and broad, designed to build
pupils‚Äô knowledge over time. Reading and maths lessons follow a clear
structure, helping pupils revisit, learn new content, and practise
regularly.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> A strong priority from the start. Phonics
is taught consistently by skilled staff, and books match children‚Äôs
reading levels. Those who fall behind receive quick support.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>SEND Support:</strong> Pupils with special educational needs
and/or disabilities are identified early and supported effectively. They
learn alongside their peers and achieve well.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Early Years:</strong> Rated <em>Outstanding</em>. Teachers
know each child well and tailor learning to their needs. A strong focus
on language and communication gives children the vocabulary and
confidence they need. Pupils develop excellent concentration and
learning behaviours.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Pupils are well prepared for
life in modern Britain, learning about respect, tolerance, online
safety, and healthy living. Leadership opportunities, such as the School
Parliament, give pupils a real voice ‚Äì including helping to interview
new staff.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Staff and Leadership:</strong> Teachers and support staff
say morale is high. Headteacher <strong>Beth Stevens</strong> was
praised for her leadership, and governors, led by <strong>Ione
Taylor</strong>, were recognised for knowing the school well and
providing strong support and challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-to-improve">Areas to improve</h2>
<p>Inspectors highlighted two main areas for further improvement:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Curriculum Implementation:</strong> In some subjects,
teaching does not fully match the school‚Äôs intentions. This means pupils
do not always make strong connections between topics.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Checking Understanding:</strong> Sometimes misconceptions
are not corrected quickly enough, so pupils can repeat errors. The
school needs to strengthen systems for checking what children know and
remember.</li>
</ol>
