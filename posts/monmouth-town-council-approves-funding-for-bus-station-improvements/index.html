<p>Monmouth Town Council has agreed to contribute to the <a
href="https://moderngov.microshadeapplications.co.uk/MonmouthTC/documents/s6352/Bus%20Station.pdf">development
of the town’s bus station</a>. The project follows the plans outlined in
the <strong>Placemaking Plan Consultation</strong> and has been
identified as a priority by both residents and the Placemaking Steering
Group.</p>
<p>Cllr Hoggins updated the Council on discussions with
<strong>Monmouthshire County Council (MCC)</strong>, who will lead the
project and are confident they can secure most of the funding. MCC
requested a contribution from the Town Council to help support the
improvements.</p>
<p>Members considered the scope of the project, including whether it
would provide meaningful improvements and whether it could include a
<strong>zebra crossing near Home Bargains</strong>.</p>
<p>The Council resolved to approve a contribution of up to
<strong>£80,000</strong> from <strong>EMR 366 PM Activities</strong>.
This funding will support the bus station development, <strong>subject
to the Town Council being satisfied with the final design</strong>.</p>
