<h1>Monmouth Planning Committee reviews key applications and boosts local safety and heritage protections</h1>
<div class="articledate">26 August 2025</div>
<p>The Monmouth Town Council Planning Committee met on Tuesday, 12th
August 2025, at 6.30 pm in the Roberts Room at Bridges. The meeting
covered several planning applications, updates on enforcement matters,
and ongoing projects affecting the town. Apologies were accepted from
Councillors Rugen-Hankey and Wilcock, and Cllr Brehany sent her
apologies during the meeting due to connectivity issues. No declarations
of interest were made by Committee members.</p>
<p>The minutes from the previous meeting held on 22nd July 2025 were
confirmed and signed as a true record. No members of the public
requested to speak during the meeting. There were no late payments for
approval. The Committee discussed four planning applications in
detail.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500728-at-3-4-drybridge-terrace">DM/2025/00728 at 3-4
Drybridge Terrace</h2>
<p>The first application, DM/2025/00728 at 3-4 Drybridge Terrace,
proposed a small single-storey rear extension. Concerns about the impact
on the historic property had been raised by the Georgian Group and
echoed by the Committee. However, the Committee felt that there was not
enough information to fully assess the potential effects on the heritage
of the building. As a result, they were unable to make a recommendation
and requested that the applicant provide additional information for
reconsultation.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500943-at-43-wonastow-road">DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow
Road</h2>
<p>The second application, DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow Road, involved
the demolition of two rear single-storey extensions and the construction
of a new single-storey and two-storey rear extension, with internal
alterations. The Committee considered the conditions recommended by
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the Ecological Report appropriate.
They recommended approval on the condition that the applicant follows
NRW recommendations, obtains a bat mitigation licence, and considers
adding bird boxes, particularly for Swifts, to support local
biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id="dm202500868-at-the-ancre-hill-rockfield-road">DM/2025/00868 at
The Ancre Hill, Rockfield Road</h2>
<p>The third application, DM/2025/00868 at The Ancre Hill, Rockfield
Road, proposed converting existing outbuildings into a single dwelling.
The Committee noted the bat survey recommendations and found the design
suitable for the location. They recommended approval, provided the
applicant adheres to the conditions in the bat survey. The fourth
application, DM/2025/01022 at 40 Monnow Keep, proposed converting a
garage door into a solid wall with a window to create additional living
accommodation. While the potential impact on parking was considered, it
was not relevant for this existing property. The Committee recommended
approval of the application.</p>
<p>The Committee also received an update from the Derelict Buildings
Working Group. The Buildings At Risk Officer for Monmouthshire County
Council, appointed on 29th July 2025, will liaise with Cllr Brehany
regarding ongoing concerns. During the review of the Action Summary, the
Committee noted the recent demolition of some buildings at Troy Station,
discussed the proposed design of the former Gate House pub, and
considered a public concern regarding paving slab colours at St Thomas
Garden, where the original Monmouth stone is no longer available. It was
noted that the Peacocks building has been purchased. Businesses and the
Chamber of Commerce will meet with County Councillor Paul Griffiths
regarding scaffolding at 10 Church Street. The Barton has now reopened
and has been removed from the Action Summary.</p>
<p>The Chairperson did not provide a report at this meeting. For future
discussions, the Committee agreed to include consultation on the
Wonastow Road footpath closure on the next agenda and to add information
about Swifts to the Town Councilâ€™s website to support local biodiversity
awareness. The next Planning Committee meeting is scheduled for Tuesday,
2nd September 2025.</p>
