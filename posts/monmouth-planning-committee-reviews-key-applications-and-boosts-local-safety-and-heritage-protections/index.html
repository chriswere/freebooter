<h1>Monmouth Planning Committee reviews key applications and boosts local safety and heritage protections</h1>
<div class="articledate">26 August 2025</div>
<p>The <strong>Monmouth Town Council Planning Committee</strong> met on
<strong>Tuesday, 12th August 2025, at 6.30 pm</strong> in the
<strong>Roberts Room at Bridges</strong>. The meeting covered several
<strong>planning applications</strong>, updates on <strong>enforcement
matters</strong>, and <strong>ongoing projects</strong> affecting the
town. <strong>Apologies</strong> were accepted from <strong>Councillors
Rugen-Hankey and Wilcock</strong>, and <strong>Cllr Brehany</strong>
sent her apologies during the meeting due to <strong>connectivity
issues</strong>. <strong>No declarations of interest</strong> were made
by Committee members.</p>
<p>The <strong>minutes</strong> from the previous meeting held on
<strong>22nd July 2025</strong> were <strong>confirmed and
signed</strong> as a true record. <strong>No members of the
public</strong> requested to speak during the meeting. There were
<strong>no late payments</strong> for approval.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed <strong>four planning applications</strong>
in detail. The first application, <strong>DM/2025/00728 at 3-4 Drybridge
Terrace</strong>, proposed a <strong>small single-storey rear
extension</strong>. <strong>Concerns about the impact on the historic
property</strong> had been raised by the <strong>Georgian Group</strong>
and echoed by the Committee. However, the Committee felt that there was
<strong>not enough information</strong> to fully assess the potential
effects on the <strong>heritage of the building</strong>. As a result,
they were <strong>unable to make a recommendation</strong> and requested
that the applicant provide <strong>additional information for
reconsultation</strong>.</p>
<p>The second application, <strong>DM/2025/00943 at 43 Wonastow
Road</strong>, involved the <strong>demolition of two rear single-storey
extensions</strong> and the <strong>construction of a new single-storey
and two-storey rear extension</strong>, with internal alterations. The
Committee considered the <strong>conditions recommended by Natural
Resources Wales (NRW)</strong> and the <strong>Ecological
Report</strong> appropriate. They <strong>recommended approval</strong>
on the condition that the applicant <strong>follows NRW
recommendations</strong>, <strong>obtains a bat mitigation
licence</strong>, and <strong>considers adding bird boxes, particularly
for Swifts</strong>, to support <strong>local biodiversity</strong>.</p>
<p>The third application, <strong>DM/2025/00868 at The Ancre Hill,
Rockfield Road</strong>, proposed <strong>converting existing
outbuildings into a single dwelling</strong>. The Committee noted the
<strong>bat survey recommendations</strong> and found the <strong>design
suitable for the location</strong>. They <strong>recommended
approval</strong>, provided the applicant <strong>adheres to the
conditions in the bat survey</strong>. The fourth application,
<strong>DM/2025/01022 at 40 Monnow Keep</strong>, proposed
<strong>converting a garage door into a solid wall with a
window</strong> to create <strong>additional living
accommodation</strong>. While the <strong>potential impact on
parking</strong> was considered, it was <strong>not relevant</strong>
for this existing property. The Committee <strong>recommended
approval</strong> of the application.</p>
<p>The Committee also received an update from the <strong>Derelict
Buildings Working Group</strong>. The <strong>Buildings At Risk
Officer</strong> for Monmouthshire County Council, appointed on
<strong>29th July 2025</strong>, will <strong>liaise with Cllr
Brehany</strong> regarding ongoing concerns. During the review of the
<strong>Action Summary</strong>, the Committee noted the <strong>recent
demolition of some buildings at Troy Station</strong>, discussed the
<strong>proposed design of the former Gate House pub</strong>, and
considered a <strong>public concern regarding paving slab colours at St
Thomas Garden</strong>, where the <strong>original Monmouth stone is no
longer available</strong>. It was noted that the <strong>Peacocks
building has been purchased</strong>. <strong>Businesses and the Chamber
of Commerce</strong> will <strong>meet with County Councillor Paul
Griffiths</strong> regarding <strong>scaffolding at 10 Church
Street</strong>. The <strong>Barton has now reopened</strong> and has
been <strong>removed from the Action Summary</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chairperson did not provide a report</strong> at this
meeting. For <strong>future discussions</strong>, the Committee agreed
to include <strong>consultation on the Wonastow Road footpath
closure</strong> on the next agenda and to add <strong>information about
Swifts</strong> to the Town Councilâ€™s <strong>website</strong> to
support <strong>local biodiversity awareness</strong>. The <strong>next
Planning Committee meeting</strong> is scheduled for <strong>Tuesday,
2nd September 2025</strong>.</p>
