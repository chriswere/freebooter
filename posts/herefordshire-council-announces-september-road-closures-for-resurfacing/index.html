<h1>Herefordshire Council announces September road closures for resurfacing</h1>
<div class="articledate">2 September 2025</div>
<p>Herefordshire Council has confirmed a series of temporary road
closures across the county this September as part of a resurfacing
programme.</p>
<p>The works will begin on <strong>1 September 2025</strong>. Each
closure is required for safety reasons while works are carried out.
Diversion routes will be signposted locally and published online at <a
href="https://one.network">One.Network</a>.</p>
<p>Although the legal order allows closures for up to <strong>18
months</strong>, the programme is expected to last <strong>around one
month</strong>, with each road closed only for the duration needed.
Exact dates and times will be shown on advanced warning signs placed
on-site.</p>
