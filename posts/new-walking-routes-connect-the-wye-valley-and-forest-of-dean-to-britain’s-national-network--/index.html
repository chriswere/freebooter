<h1>New walking routes connect the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean to Britain’s national network  </h1>
<div class="articledate">28 August 2025</div>
<p>A growing national project is opening up new opportunities for
walkers in the <strong>Wye Valley and Forest of Dean</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://slowways.org">Slow Ways</a>, a not-for-profit,
citizen-led initiative, is building a walking network that connects
every town, city, and national landscape in Britain. The idea is simple:
if people know there’s a safe and clear way to walk somewhere, they’re
more likely to do it.</p>
<p>Started in 2020 by geographer <strong>Dan Raven-Ellison</strong>,
Slow Ways has grown with the help of thousands of volunteers. Together
they have created nearly <strong>10,000 routes</strong> linking over
<strong>2,500 places</strong>. Many of these walks pass through or
connect to our area – from the <strong>market towns of the Forest of
Dean</strong> to the villages and riverside paths of the <strong>Wye
Valley</strong>.</p>
<p>The Slow Ways routes are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be safe, direct, and accessible<br />
</li>
<li>Avoid busy roads where possible<br />
</li>
<li>Include resting places every 5–10 km<br />
</li>
<li>Pass through public transport hubs<br />
</li>
<li>Be enjoyable and easy to follow</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every path is suitable for everyone, but routes are tested by
walkers and wheelchair/scooter users. Reviews, star ratings, and surveys
help highlight surface quality, gradients, and obstacles like stiles or
mud. Routes with three or more positive reviews become “verified” –
tried and tested by the community.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is about more than just hiking. It encourages people to
walk or wheel for everyday journeys, like visiting friends, shopping, or
commuting, as well as for longer adventures.</p>
<p>You can explore the routes through the <strong>Slow Ways
website</strong>, their iOS and Android apps, or printed maps and
atlases. Each walk comes with practical advice and friendly tips from
other walkers to help you on your way.</p>
<p>Slow Ways is powered by citizens, not governments – although the team
hopes local and national authorities will support and invest in the
future of walking.</p>
<p>Their long-term vision is for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone</strong> – safe and inclusive routes for all
abilities<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Everywhere</strong> – a walking network as simple to use as
the road system<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Every day</strong> – walking and wheeling as natural parts
of daily life<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Every time</strong> – reliable paths, with data to give
confidence before setting out</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to explore or contribute to this growing network, visit
<a href="https://slowways.org">slowways.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can also share your own experiences, review routes, and help
verify paths in the Wye Valley and Forest of Dean. Every contribution
makes a difference – strengthening a network that connects people to
nature, to each other, and to the wider world.</p>
