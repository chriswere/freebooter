		<h1>Monmouth Town Council approves funding for bus station improvements</h1>

<p>Monmouth Town Council has agreed to contribute to the <a href="https://moderngov.microshadeapplications.co.uk/MonmouthTC/documents/s6352/Bus%20Station.pdf">development of the town’s bus station</a>. The project follows the plans outlined in the <strong>Placemaking Plan Consultation</strong> and has been identified as a priority by both residents and the Placemaking Steering Group.</p>
<p>Cllr Hoggins updated the Council on discussions with <strong>Monmouthshire County Council (MCC)</strong>, who will lead the project and are confident they can secure most of the funding. MCC requested a contribution from the Town Council to help support the improvements.</p>
<p>Members considered the scope of the project, including whether it would provide meaningful improvements and whether it could include a <strong>zebra crossing near Home Bargains</strong>.</p>
<p>The Council resolved to approve a contribution of up to <strong>£80,000</strong> from <strong>EMR 366 PM Activities</strong>. This funding will support the bus station development, <strong>subject to the Town Council being satisfied with the final design</strong>.</p>
<p>Councillors also discussed several broader public transport issues raised by residents or based on their own experiences, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lack of connectivity to other public transport hubs such as train stations.<br />
</li>
<li>Lack of connectivity to key facilities such as hospitals.<br />
</li>
<li>Incorrect information being displayed either online or at bus stops.<br />
</li>
<li>The reintroduction of a double-decker bus from Hereford to Monmouth that is often empty and not suitable for the roads it uses.</li>
</ol>
<p>To address these concerns, the Council resolved to arrange an <strong>Extraordinary Full Council meeting</strong> on public transport in Monmouth and to invite the relevant <strong>Cabinet Member and MCC Officers</strong> to attend.</p>
