<p>Two men have been arrested after a drone was reported flying over HMP
Long Lartin in South Littleton, Worcestershire, on Monday night (18
August).</p>
<p>Police were called around 11.50pm after the drone dropped a package
of suspected contraband before flying away. A blue Seat Leon believed to
be linked to the incident was later stopped at Stafford services on the
M6.</p>
<p>Two men in their 20s were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to
convey prohibited items into a prison. A drone, the car, and the
recovered package have all been seized for forensic examination.</p>
<p>The men remain in custody while enquiries continue.</p>
