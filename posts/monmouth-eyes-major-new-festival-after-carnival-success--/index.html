<p>Monmouth could soon be home to a brand-new music festival, following
a pitch at the latest <strong>Full Council meeting</strong> on Monday
14th July 2025.</p>
<p>Ceri Jones, one of the organisers behind <strong>Monmouth
Carnival</strong>, addressed councillors during the public participation
session to share the exciting idea. Building on the success of the
Carnivalâ€™s <strong>Battle of the Bands</strong>, Jones and fellow
organisers hope to launch a <strong>three-day festival</strong> at the
end of June 2026, running alongside Carnival weekend on
<strong>Chippenham Mead</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-festival-vision">A new festival vision</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proposed festival would be <strong>shorter than the old Monmouth
Music Festival</strong> (3 days instead of 9).<br />
</li>
<li>Rough site layouts and a <strong>mock poster</strong> were shown at
the meeting.<br />
</li>
<li>Early discussions with current Monmouth Music Festival members
suggest there is support for the new venture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ms Jones explained that the festival could cost around
<strong>Â£100,000 to stage</strong>, with organisers planning to apply
for <strong>grants, sponsorships, and match-funding</strong>. If
ticketed, entry could cost about <strong>Â£25</strong>, potentially
attracting <strong>10,000 people</strong> and raising enough for a
profit of around <strong>Â£60,000</strong>. That profit could help fund
future festivals or even be donated to schools and community groups for
<strong>music education</strong>. The dream, however, is to make the
<strong>first year free</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="music-line-up-hopes">Music line-up hopes</h2>
<p>The organisers are already exploring acts, with bands such as
<strong>The Pigeon Detectives, Bastille, and Sam Ryder</strong> within
the projected budget.<br />
The plan is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the <strong>main stage with Carnival</strong> to cut
costs.<br />
</li>
<li>Keep <strong>Carnival stalls on site</strong> to add to the
atmosphere.<br />
</li>
<li>Run a schedule with <strong>main acts on Friday and Saturday
nights</strong>, and smaller performances closing out Sunday
afternoon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions-from-councillors">Questions from councillors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: Some funds had previously been set aside
for the old Monmouth Music Festival, but the Town Clerk confirmed no
budget currently exists for the new event. Support might be reconsidered
later or added into the <strong>2026/27 budget</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Permissions</strong>: Concerns were raised over the need for
official permission to use Chippenham Mead, which will require
discussions with <strong>Monmouthshire County Council</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these hurdles, councillors agreed they were enthusiastic
about the idea and asked Jones to return with <strong>confirmed
permissions, detailed costings, and further talks with the Monmouth
Music Festival committee</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="carnivals-musical-momentum">Carnivalâ€™s musical momentum</h2>
<p>The announcement comes hot on the heels of the Carnivalâ€™s
<strong>Battle of the Bands</strong>, held on Sunday 29th June 2025.</p>
<p>From <strong>60 hopeful bands</strong>, six made it through to the
final showdown â€” including Leeds-based <strong>Fake Fame</strong>,
Cardiffâ€™s <strong>Four Act Riot</strong>, and Aberystwyth favourites
<strong>Misha and the Kings</strong>. Local young talent also shone with
school band <strong>HZRD</strong> and sibling trio
<strong>Hillsy</strong> impressing the crowd.</p>
<p>The competition climaxed with a <strong>headline set from Kira
Mac</strong>, whose powerhouse frontwoman Rhiannon even offered two
lucky bands the chance to <strong>support them on tour</strong>. The
atmosphere was electric, leaving many convinced that Monmouth is ready
for something bigger.</p>
<p>With community backing, the Carnival organisers believe a <strong>new
festival could put Monmouth firmly back on the live music map</strong>.
All eyes now turn to the councilâ€™s autumn budget discussions and the
ongoing talks with Monmouthshire County Council.</p>
