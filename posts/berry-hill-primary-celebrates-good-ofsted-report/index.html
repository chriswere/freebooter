<h1>Berry Hill Primary celebrates "good" Ofsted report</h1>
<div class="articledate">3 July 2025</div>
<p>Berry Hill Primary School in Coleford is celebrating after inspectors
rated the school <strong>“Good”</strong> in all areas following their
visit on <strong>3rd and 4th June 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The report marks a big step forward for the school, which was judged
as <em>“Requires Improvement”</em> at its last inspection in January
2023.</p>
<h2 id="strong-values-and-positive-atmosphere">Strong values and
positive atmosphere</h2>
<p>Inspectors praised the school’s ethos, built around the <strong>“3
Bs: be kind, be respectful, be your best.”</strong><br />
They found that pupils feel safe, happy, and eager to learn. Children
treat each other with kindness and respect, and enjoy taking on
responsibilities such as being house captains or members of the pupil
parliament.</p>
<p>The report also highlighted pupils’ <strong>tolerance and
compassion</strong>, noting that they understand discrimination is wrong
and support classmates who need extra help.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-school-does-well">What the school does well</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> Teachers have designed lessons that
reflect Berry Hill’s local context while also broadening pupils’
horizons. The curriculum is especially well thought out for children
with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> Children begin learning phonics as soon as
they join Reception. Most are fluent readers by the end of Year 2. Those
with speech and language difficulties are well supported to catch
up.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Maths:</strong> Results in 2024 were below average, but a
new approach has now strengthened pupils’ understanding. Inspectors saw
both younger and older children making good progress.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>SEND Support:</strong> Staff now identify pupils’ needs much
earlier and adapt lessons well. As a result, pupils with SEND achieve
strongly.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Pupils are encouraged to
become reflective, confident, and socially responsible.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Headteacher <strong>Amy Pugh</strong>
and her team were praised for their clear and ambitious vision, which
staff consistently follow. Governors, led by <strong>Tracey
Johnson</strong>, were said to have an accurate view of the school’s
strengths and areas for growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-to-improve">Areas to improve</h2>
<p>Inspectors also noted areas where the school still needs to
improve:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Deeper Learning:</strong> Sometimes pupils are not
challenged enough to extend their knowledge.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Handwriting, spelling, and punctuation are
not taught consistently well, meaning some pupils keep repeating
errors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Early Years:</strong> In Reception, children do not always
get enough chances to apply skills across different areas of learning,
which can affect preparation for Year 1.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="early-years-and-beyond">Early years and beyond</h2>
<p>Children in Reception get a strong start in reading, writing, and
maths, though inspectors said they sometimes miss out on wider
opportunities.<br />
Across the school, behaviour was described as good, with only occasional
fussiness that is quickly managed by staff.</p>
<h2 id="safeguarding">Safeguarding</h2>
<p>Safeguarding arrangements were found to be
<strong>effective</strong>, with inspectors confident that children’s
welfare is a top priority.</p>
