<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a wide range of planning
applications in recent weeks, covering tree maintenance, removals,
property renovations, and historic building repairs. The decisions
highlight the councilâ€™s ongoing efforts to balance safety, preservation,
and modern living needs across the county.</p>
<h2 id="tree-works">Tree works</h2>
<p>In Abergavenny, five trees at 15 Wedgwood Gardens will undergo
maintenance. Two ash trees suffering from ash dieback will be reduced to
monoliths to encourage regeneration, while two further ash trees leaning
over Hillside Road will have overhanging branches removed and crowns
thinned to improve safety. A sweet chestnut will also have branches
overhanging the road removed.</p>
<p>In Caldicot, approval was granted for the removal of a single conifer
at 45 Church Road. Meanwhile, at 34 Woodside, Llanbadoc, a leylandi and
a conifer on the driveway side of the property will be removed.</p>
<p>At Silver How, Llanhennock, multiple trees will undergo works
including crown reductions, removal of deadwood, and felling of dead or
diseased trees such as ash, elm, and beech. Several oak trees will have
crown lifting and removal of excessive growth to ensure safety and
improve long-term health.</p>
<p>In Chepstow, two mature walnut trees at Crossways Farm will have
crowns thinned by up to 20% and lower limbs removed where they overhang
the pavement and driveway.</p>
<p>Other approved tree works include shaping and reduction of cherry and
hawthorn trees at Applecross Cottage, Mathern, felling of a Magnolia at
Masonic Hall, Monmouth, and a 30% crown reduction of a Sycamore at 9
Company Farm Drive, Llanfoist.</p>
<p>At Bushes Farm, Chapel Road, Earlswood, Shirenewton, the council
approved the discharge of Condition 8 linked to a previous planning
decision, allowing tree-related works on the site to proceed in line
with approved plans.</p>
<h2 id="property-renovations-and-historic-building-works">Property
renovations and historic building works</h2>
<p>At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the
discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent.
The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the timber cupola, a
small decorative structure on top of the main roof that provides
ventilation and adds architectural character to the historic house. The
restoration will preserve this key architectural feature while ensuring
it remains safe and functional.</p>
<p>In Grosmont, modifications to a previous approval at Broome Villa,
Hand Road were approved. The works involve extending, improving, and
remodelling the detached house and outbuildings, alongside creating a
new vehicular access and parking area, modernising the property while
maintaining harmony with the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>At Merrig Mill, Tregagle, Trellech, a series of renovations and
small-scale construction projects were approved. These include
converting a single-storey stone outbuilding, formerly used as a stable,
into a bedroom and shower room, constructing a new small stable attached
to the ancillary barn, and renovating an existing barn within the
domestic curtilage for personal residential use.</p>
<p>All applications were validated and decided between 26 and 27 August
2025.</p>
