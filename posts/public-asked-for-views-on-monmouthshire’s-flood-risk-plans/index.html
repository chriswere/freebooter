<p>Monmouthshire County Council is asking residents to share their views
on how the county manages flood risk. A public consultation is now open
on the councilâ€™s draft <strong>Local Flood Risk Management
Strategy</strong>, which sets out plans for the next six years.</p>
<p>The consultation runs from <strong>Friday 1 August until Friday 26
September, 2025</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-consultation-about">Whatâ€™s the consultation
about?</h2>
<p>The draft strategy explains how the council plans to deal with
flooding from surface water, groundwater and smaller local rivers and
streams. It builds on the countyâ€™s first flood strategy from 2013 and
takes into account lessons from recent major floods, new legislation and
national policy changes.</p>
<p>Residents are being asked to give feedback on the proposals, either
online or by filling in a paper survey available from their nearest
Community Hub. The council says local experiences are vital to shaping
its plans.</p>

<p>Once the consultation closes, the council will review the feedback

approval before being sent to the Welsh Government. The council expects
to publish an update later in <strong>late 2025 or early
2026</strong>.</p>
