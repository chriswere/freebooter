<h1>Public asked for views on Monmouthshire’s flood risk plans</h1>
<div class="articledate">28 August 2025</div>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council is asking residents to share their views
on how the county manages flood risk. A public consultation is now open
on the council’s draft <strong>Local Flood Risk Management
Strategy</strong>, which sets out plans for the next six years.</p>
<p>The consultation runs from <strong>Friday 1 August until Friday 26
September, 2025</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-consultation-about">What’s the consultation
about?</h2>
<p>The draft strategy explains how the council plans to deal with
flooding from surface water, groundwater and smaller local rivers and
streams. It builds on the county’s first flood strategy from 2013 and
takes into account lessons from recent major floods, new legislation and
national policy changes.</p>
<p>Residents are being asked to give feedback on the proposals, either
online or by filling in a paper survey available from their nearest
Community Hub. The council says local experiences are vital to shaping
its plans.</p>
<h2 id="drop-in-events">Drop-in events</h2>

<p>Once the consultation closes, the council will review the feedback

approval before being sent to the Welsh Government. The council expects
to publish an update later in <strong>late 2025 or early
2026</strong>.</p>
