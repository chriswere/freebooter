<p><strong>Raglan, 25 June 2025</strong> â€“ Raglan Community Council held
its ordinary meeting at the Fellowship Centre on Wednesday evening,
welcoming new councillor Luke Thompson and discussing a range of local
issues from road safety to dog waste bins.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-a-new-councillor">Welcome to a new councillor</h2>
<p>Luke Thompson officially joined the council, signing his declaration
of office. Chair Cllr Nick Ramsay welcomed him to the team, promising a
smooth start as he settles into his new role.</p>
<h2 id="residents-speak-up">Residents speak up</h2>
<p>A local resident raised concerns about the Chepstow Road to Llandenny
junction. The council confirmed it has already contacted Monmouthshire
Highways, and the Clerk will follow up to find out when the planned
safety improvements are expected.</p>
<h2 id="planning-concerns-continue">Planning concerns continue</h2>
<p>Council members discussed ongoing frustrations with planning officers
who have not responded to previous correspondence. The council has now
decided to make a formal complaint about the lack of communication.</p>
<p>A separate planning issue on land adjacent to High Street, Raglan,
also caught the councilâ€™s attention. The proposed development of three
houses was flagged as a potential traffic risk on the A40 trunk road.
The council will formally object and request a decision timeline from
the planning department.</p>
<h2 id="dog-walk-and-allotment-updates">Dog walk and allotment
updates</h2>
<p>The popular Dog Walk area needs urgent attention. Overgrown grass,
damaged footpaths, and dead trees are affecting the site. The council
will take matters into its own hands, arranging maintenance, clearing
debris, and upgrading footpaths.</p>
<p>Allotments also remain a priority. Some plots have been neglected,
and the council will remind tenants of their responsibilities and
consider reallocating plots where necessary.</p>
<h2 id="waste-and-cleanliness">Waste and cleanliness</h2>
<p>Dog waste bins purchased by the council will soon be installed by
Monmouthshire County Council, following communication with both the
contractor and council officers.</p>
<h2 id="community-support-and-events">Community support and events</h2>
<p>The council approved several grants, including contributions to the
Raglan Festival, St Cadoc Church, and the Baptist Church. Members also
discussed the Community Award Scheme and plan to meet with the Baptist
Church and Minister to set clear guidelines for future awards.</p>
<h2 id="village-life-updates">Village life updates</h2>
<p>Cllr Penny Jones raised two important village matters: bus timetable
accessibility and Christmas decorations. Residents have reported that
digital bus timetables are difficult to read, so paper copies will also
be installed. Plans for festive lighting are also underway, with council
representatives following up with county officers to ensure decorations
return in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="other-business">Other business</h2>
<p>The council approved the internal audit for the year ending March
2025 and agreed to submit it to Audit Wales. Several planning
applications were reviewed, with most receiving no objections, while one
application has been withdrawn and will be resubmitted.</p>
<p>The meeting closed at 8:14 pm, with the next session scheduled for 23
July 2025.</p>
