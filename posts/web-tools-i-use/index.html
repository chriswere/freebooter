<h1>Web tools I use</h1>
24 August 2025
<h2 id="front-ends">Front ends</h2>
<p>This page used to have a lot more front ends to websites such as
Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, however over the years, these platforms have
tightened their APIs and made it difficult to use their platforms with
3rd party tools. As a result of this, I’m trying to use <em>free and
open source</em> alternatives to the big tech services.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://redirect.invidious.io">Invidious</a>: Managed by
friend of <a
href="https://video.thepolarbear.co.uk/c/the_freebooters">Freeboosters</a>
<a href="https://github.com/TheFrenchGhosty">TheFrenchGhosty</a>
Invidious is one of the best ways to interact with YouTube. Whilst the
number of instances are dwindling due to YouTube aggressive
enshitification, it’s still an incredible admirable project.</li>
<li><a href="https://lingva.ml">Lingva Translate</a> (<a
href="https://github.com/TheDavidDelta/lingva-translate">project
page</a>): A FOSS front-end for Google Translate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-browser-add-ons">Web browser add-ons</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kubuzetto/behind">behind!</a>: This is a
great tool for helping you download photos and videos from many
websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>: The best ad
blocking tool out there, and the primary reason I’m still using Firefox
web browser.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="online-resources">Online resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dafont.com">DaFont</a>: A large collection of
fonts, searchable by licence.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com">Font Squirrel</a>: A large
collection of fonts, searchable by licence.</li>
<li><a href="http://freepd.com">FreePD</a>: A large library of public
domain music. I don’t use music in my videos any more, but this still
remains the best place for public domain stock music.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closed-source-web-apps">Closed source web apps</h2>
<p>Whilst I avoid using non-FOSS tools whenever possible, the following
are what I’ll make an exception for.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://temp-mail.org">Temp Mail</a>: This allows you to
set up a one-time-use temporary email address for signing up to online
services. I use it for all accounts that I don’t consider important, and
for services where I don’t which to leave my real email address.</li>
</ul>
