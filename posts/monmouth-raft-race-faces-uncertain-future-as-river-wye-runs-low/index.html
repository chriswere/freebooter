		<h1>Monmouth Raft Race faces uncertain future as River Wye runs low</h1>

<p>The 58th Monmouth Raft Race could be in jeopardy this year as the
drought-hit River Wye continues to struggle with extremely low water
levels. Organisers are monitoring the situation closely and plan to make
a final decision on Sunday 31 August.</p>
<p>Norman Williams, who has run the raft race for the past 22 years,
said: ‚ÄúAt the moment it‚Äôs difficult to say what is happening. We will
watch the weather and have a meeting this Sunday, August 31. At present
we have 45 entrants all hoping to raise money for good causes. We
sincerely hope that the event can go ahead. Perhaps praying for rain is
our last hope?‚Äù</p>
<p>The low water levels pose several challenges. Around 400 yards of the
course may only be navigable by dragging or carrying rafts over the
stony riverbed, creating safety risks, especially for heavier rafts.
Crews are being advised to keep rafts as light as possible and ensure
they have the physical capability to handle these tricky sections.</p>
<p>The river is also flowing slowly, meaning participants will need
extra effort to complete the six-mile course. Beyond the practical
concerns, there are environmental worries. The Wye is a vital habitat
currently under stress, with high river temperatures threatening fish
populations, according to Natural Resources Wales. Holding the race
could disturb the wildlife and damage the riverbed in these fragile
conditions.</p>
<p>If the race is cancelled, entry fees will be refunded, though
organisers are encouraging participants to consider donating their fees
to St David‚Äôs Hospice Care, a Gwent-based charity providing free,
at-home care to patients with life-threatening illnesses. The same
option is available to those who withdraw voluntarily.</p>
<p>The race is scheduled to start at noon on Sunday 7 September from
Monmouth Rowing Club, following a 6.5-mile route down the Wye to Tump
Farm, Whitebrook, where a family festival with entertainment and
refreshments awaits. Participants are encouraged to seek sponsorship
from employers or local pubs, combining team-building fun with support
for a worthy cause.</p>
