<p>Coalway Community Infant School has been praised for improvements in
teaching and behaviour, following a <strong>monitoring inspection on
19th March 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The visit, led by His Majesty‚Äôs Inspector <strong>Nicky
McMahon</strong>, found that while the school still has work to do,
leaders have taken <strong>positive steps since the last full
inspection</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-in-teaching-and-learning">Improvements in teaching
and learning</h2>
<p>Reading and phonics have been made a <strong>top priority</strong>.
Staff have received extra training, and phonics lessons are now taught
more consistently. Checks on pupils‚Äô reading help teachers to spot gaps
early and provide extra support.</p>
<p>Work to improve <strong>writing</strong> is the next step, with
leaders recognising its importance for progress across all subjects.</p>
<p>In the wider curriculum, the school has identified key knowledge for
pupils to learn and has started using new systems to check what children
remember. This is helping to fill gaps, though inspectors said there is
still <strong>more work needed</strong> to make sure teaching and
assessment are consistent in all subjects.</p>
<p>In <strong>early years</strong>, the curriculum has been
strengthened, especially around language development and the learning
environment. However, these changes are still new and need more time to
embed.</p>
<h2 id="behaviour-and-atmosphere">Behaviour and atmosphere</h2>
<p>Inspectors reported that the school is now <strong>calm and
orderly</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staff share clear expectations for behaviour.<br />
</li>
<li>Pupils understand the rules and show <strong>positive attitudes to
learning</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Disruptions in class are now minimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The school is also starting to adapt its approach to better meet the
needs of all pupils.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>The report highlighted that many improvements are still at an
<strong>early stage</strong>. Leaders need clearer plans and timescales
to track progress more effectively. Governors are ambitious and
supportive, but many are new to their roles and still developing their
impact.</p>
<p>Coalway is working closely with external advisors and the local
authority and has shown it is open to advice and support.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Ofsted concluded that <strong>‚ÄúLeaders have made progress to improve
the school, but some aspects need further improvement.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>Parents and carers can be reassured that the school is moving in the
right direction, with strong foundations now being put in place for the
future.</p>
