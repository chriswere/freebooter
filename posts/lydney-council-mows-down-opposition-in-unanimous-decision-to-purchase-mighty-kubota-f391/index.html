		<h1>Lydney Council mows down opposition in unanimous decision to purchase mighty Kubota F391</h1>

<p>It was the kind of council debate that could make or break the lawns
of Lydney for generations to come: should the town invest in a brand-new
grass mower? After much deliberation (and, one assumes, a few wistful
glances out at Bathurst Park’s expansive greenery), councillors voted
unanimously to approve a five-year hire purchase agreement for the
Kubota F391 Outfront Mower — a machine so powerful it could probably
shave a cricket pitch into a snooker table if asked politely.</p>

<p>Head Gardener James, the unsung hero of the town’s grassy horizons,
presented his case for the 37-horsepower diesel beast. No longer would
the council’s green team have to wrestle with outdated kit; now, they
would be armed with hydrostatic all-wheel-drive, LED headlights, and —
perhaps most importantly — a 72-inch cutting deck capable of chewing
through unruly tufts faster than you can say “mulching efficiency.”</p>
<p>The Kubota F391, described in the manufacturer’s blurb as “the
efficiency machine,” promises not only to keep Lydney’s parks trim and
proper but also to deliver an “excellent power-to-cost ratio.” In plain
English: it’s expensive, yes, but it cuts grass very, very well.</p>
<p>Councillors were suitably impressed. “This mower doesn’t just cut
grass, it defines a town,” one might imagine a councillor saying as
visions of perfectly striped verges danced before their eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, in the age of accountability, the mower’s movements will
not go unmonitored. Alongside the purchase, the council requested
costings on fitting GPS trackers to all council vehicles, including this
new leviathan of lawn care. After all, nobody wants to wake up one
morning to find the pride of Lydney Council joyriding through
Coleford.</p>
<p>While the finer points of mulching quality, ergonomic operator
platforms, and puncture-proof support wheels may not capture the
imagination of every resident, there is little doubt that the decision
will have visible consequences. From Bathurst Park to the Mesne,
Lydney’s green spaces look set to be manicured with precision that would
make even Wimbledon’s groundskeepers blush.</p>
<p>The verdict is in: the Kubota F391 is coming to town. And while it
may not solve traffic problems, planning disputes, or the eternal saga
of community asset listings, at least the grass will look immaculate
while those debates rage on.</p>
