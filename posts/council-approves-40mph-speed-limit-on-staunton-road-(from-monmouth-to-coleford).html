		<h1>Council approves 40mph speed limit on Staunton Road (from Monmouth to Coleford)</h1>

<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a new <strong>40mph speed limit</strong> on Staunton Road (A4136) following a detailed engineering assessment and community consultation. The decision was part of the Individual Cabinet Member Decision meeting held on Wednesday, 20th August 2025 at 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>The change is aimed at addressing urgent safety concerns on this strategic route, which connects Monmouth to Gloucestershire and carries a variety of vehicles, including heavy goods traffic, with limited alternative routes.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-change-was-needed">Why the change was needed</h2>
<p>An engineering assessment highlighted that the existing speed limit on Staunton Road is <strong>inappropriate for the road’s geometry and traffic conditions</strong>. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>documented collision cluster</strong> between Wyesham and the county boundary, with <strong>five recorded collisions between 2020 and 2023</strong>, including one fatality.<br />
</li>
<li>The road is heavily used by a range of vehicles, some of which are large, including heavy goods vehicles, creating higher safety risks at current speeds.<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>poor road condition</strong> further increases the risk of accidents, making a lower speed limit necessary for safe navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council concluded that a 40mph limit is the safest option for this section of road and will help prevent future collisions.</p>
<h2 id="support-from-local-community">Support from local community</h2>
<p>Monmouth Town Council has expressed support for the proposed TRO. They highlighted that Staunton Road is used by a variety of vehicles, including large vehicles, and that <strong>slower speeds will improve safety for all road users</strong>. The Council also noted that the road’s current condition requires careful navigation, which is better managed under a lower speed limit.</p>
<h2 id="expected-benefits">Expected benefits</h2>
<p>The introduction of the 40mph limit on Staunton Road is expected to have several positive impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved safety for all road users</strong> by reducing the likelihood and severity of collisions.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Health benefits for the community</strong>, as fewer accidents reduce the burden on emergency services and healthcare providers.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency with wider road safety measures</strong> across Monmouthshire, particularly in areas with documented collision clusters such as Staunton Road and the B4235 between Chepstow and Mynydd Bach.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Better traffic management</strong>, particularly for heavy goods vehicles using this strategic route.</li>
</ul>
<p>Council officers noted that these changes are part of a wider programme to create a safer, more consistent speed limit framework across the county and to support sustainable travel where possible.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The 40mph speed limit will be formally implemented as part of the Monmouthshire County Council Traffic Regulation, Speed Limits, and Parking Regulations Consolidation Order 2019 (Amendment Order No. 17).<br />
</li>
<li>New signage will be installed, and the TRO will be legally enforceable to ensure compliance.<br />
</li>
<li>Residents and road users are encouraged to observe the new limit and continue reporting safety concerns to the Council.</li>
</ul>
