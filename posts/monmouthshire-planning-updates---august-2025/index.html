<h1>Monmouthshire planning updates - August 2025</h1>
<div class="articledate">27 August 2025</div>
<p>Monmouthshire County Council has approved a number of planning
applications in recent weeks, covering refurbishment, renovations, and
property extensions across the county.</p>
<p>At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the
discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent.
The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the existing timber
cupola on the main roof, as part of the ongoing preservation of the
historic property.</p>
<p>In Grosmont, modifications to an earlier planning approval at Broome
Villa, Hand Road were approved. The work involves extending, improving,
and remodelling the detached house and outbuildings, as well as creating
a new vehicular access and parking area for the property.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Merrig Mill, Tregagle, Trellech, a series of
renovations and small-scale construction projects were approved. The
plans cover three projects, conversion of an existing single-storey
stone outbuilding, formerly a stable, into a bedroom and shower room;
construction of a new small stable attached to the south side of the
ancillary barn; and renovation of an existing barn within the domestic
curtilage for personal residential use.</p>
<p>At Clytha Park House, Clytha Park Estate, the council approved the
discharge of Condition 4 linked to a previous listed building consent.
The work allows the refurbishment and repair of the timber cupola, a
small decorative structure on the top of the main roof that provides
ventilation and adds architectural character to the historic
building.</p>
<p>All decisions were issued between 26 and 27 August 2025.</p>
